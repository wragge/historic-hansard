#### RESIGNATION OF MINISTERS

##### Mr WATSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; Bland &middot; ALP</small>

.- I desire to intimate to the House that, following on the vote which was given on Friday last, I waited upon  His Excellency  the Governor-General, and offered certain advice, upon which  His Excellency  did not see fit to act. I then tendered the resignations of myself and colleagues, which  His Excellency  was pleased to accept, contingent upon our retaining office until the appointment of our successors. As I understand that a new Administration is in process of formation, I now move - 

  >That the House do now adjourn. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

House adjourned at  2.33 p.m.
