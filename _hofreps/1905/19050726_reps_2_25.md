#### RETIRING ALLOWANCES OF SYDNEY POSTAL OFFICIALS

##### Mr G B EDWARDS:<br><small class="text-muted">SOUTH SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; FT</small>

asked the PostmasterGeneral,  *upon notice -* 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. If Messrs. Frizzell and Bartholomew, formerly employed at the Sydney Post Office, and retired after many years' meritorious service for the reason that they had grown old, had to wait many months, while in indigent circumstances, for their retiring allowances? 
1. If the allowances ultimately paid these men were not largely reduced at the instance of the State Government? 
2. If retiring allowances to similar officers under similar circumstances have not been previously paid on the scale of a month's pay for each year of service? 
3. If the Department has been legally advised as to the statutory rights of such officers accruing under the Public Service Acts ' of New South Wales, and the method of computing the amounts payable by the State and- Federal Governmentsrespectively ? 

##### Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Protectionist</small>

-- The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follow :  -  1 and 2. The officers mentioned, having attained the age of sixty-five years, were each granted six months' furlough on full pay from 1st July, 1904, and were retired from the Service at its termination on 31st December last in accordance with section 74 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. 

The State Public Service Board was asked in October, 1904, to have the necessary computations made in connexion with the retiring allowances payable in these cases, and when received it was found that such computations had been made on the basis of a fortnight's pay for each year of service prior to 23rd December,1895. 

As in some previous cases, retiring allowances, on the basis of one month's pay for each year of service, had been granted, the State Board was asked on the 6th and 8th December, 1904, respectively, to advise as to the amounts payable to Fizzell and Bartholomew on that basis. 

A reply was not received until early in January, 1905, and it did not give full information. The latest information available is that the State Board is in communication on the subject with the AttorneyGeneral for New South Wales. Pending a decision by the State authorities on the point at issue, authority was given in April, 1905, to pay the gratuities at the lower rate.

##### Sir WILLIAM LYNE:<br><small class="text-muted">Protectionist</small>

-- In reply to the honorable member, I desire to state - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. I have no other information than the press paragraphs.

### MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

##### Mr DEAKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister of External Affairs &middot; Ballarat &middot; Protectionist</small>

-- I move - 

  >That Statutory Rules No. 12 and 23 under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, laid on the table on 26th July, be printed. 

I do this for the purpose of placing all honorable members upon an equal footing with regard to the discussion of the Ministerial statement ; but I sincerely hope that as few honorable members as possible will take advantage of the opportunity offered. An occasion of this kind would usually require some general statement from the new Administration charged with the leadership of the House; but in the present instance, in order to economize time, that can be very briefly summarized. This Ministry adheres to the practical policy sanctioned by the country at the last general election, and already submitted to this House, and exists for the purpose of giving effect to it. A majority of the members of the Cabinet are directly responsible for the programme submitted to Parliament in 1904, which was then accepted in almost every particular by our present colleagues, so that we represent to-day the same policy and the same party. The circumstances of our assumption of office prevent a formal submission of our programme in a speech from the Governor-General, but this is rendered comparatively immaterial, because the speech of  His Excellency  at the opening of this Parliament remains almost as completely applicable now as sixteen months ago, when it was. delivered. To refresh the memories of honorable members, I will rapidly run through the programme then formulated, and now re-submitted. Taking the subjects mentioned in the order in which they appear in  His  Excellency's speech of March, 1904, honorable members will find - The taking over of the debts of the States (1), and compensation for transferred properties (2) mentioned in the third paragraph. The discussion on the first of these has been advanced a stage bv the Hobart Conference, whilst the joint valuations for the second are now about to be commenced. A Commonwealth system of old-age pensions is now under inquiry by a Royal Commission, and will be considered at the first opportunity (3). The encouragement of rural occupations (4), in particular by means of preferential trade (5) ; bounties for new products (6) : and speedier and cheaper transportation of meat, butter, and fruit, under improved conditions (7), will be attempted as soon as possible. To attract population (8), and to make provision for the appointment of a High Commissioner (9), are kindred ends to be achieved, together with, and in relation to, the matters just mentioned, with which they are closely allied. _ A Bill relating to navigation and shipping (10) in the light of the report expected from the Royal Commission now sitting, is in contemplation. The Bill for the establishment of the iron and steel industry (11) is under revision. (12) Two Ocean Mail Contracts provisionally accepted will be submitted, while (13) the whole question of subsidies for sea carriage will be brought under review as part of the general forward policy already alluded to. We hope to receive reports from the Tariff Commission, probably during the present session, and to take them into immediate consideration. The Budget will be framed upon the same plan outlined in 1904 (14). A continuance of the Sugar Bounty for a further period will' be proposed (15). The Pacific Cable Conference is now being held, and will shortly report upon present and future arrangements (16V The Western 

Australian Railway Survey Bill (17), the Papua Bill (18), and the Trade Marks Bill (19) are approaching their final stage. The Bill for an Inter-State Commission appears no longer urgent, as the preferential rates on railways have been practically abolished, and differential wharfage charges are being removed. The amendment of the Electoral Act (20),. projected in 1903, will be laid before you this session, providing for more effective administration. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">PARRAMATTA, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; FT; ANTI-SOC from 1906; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917</small>

--  Is that the extent of its scope? 

##### Mr DEAKIN:

-- There will be another Bill. The other Bills promised relating to (21) Copyright; (22) Parliamentary Witnesses ; (23) Merchandise Marks - now replaced by Commerce Bill; (24) Rings and Trusts; (25) Quarantine; (26) Lighthouses, &amp;c, are all in hand, and most of them ready for submission. The clauses of which the former Fraudulent Trades Marks Bill consisted having been divided, some of them have been added to the Trades Marks Bill, and the remainder expanded and embodied in the Commerce Bill. In addition to these, there are new measures to be brought forward this session. The Government is of opinion that (27) the constitutional method of determining the precise time at which the representation in the House of the people of the respective States shall be increased or diminished according to their numbers is by an Act of the Parliament. The dangers of leaving changes of this character in the hands of any Ministry, and of permitting them either to be set on foot at any moment merely by Executive Order, or to be delayed at Executive will, are obvious. Parliament itself should decide, subject to the Constitution, when and in what circumstances the representation shall be altered. A Bill to accomplish this will be introduced. Another important Bill will, it is hoped, effectually suppress what are known as Secret Commissions so far as they exist in the field of Commonwealth jurisdiction. In the light of the evidence before the Butter Commission the urgency of coping with the evil will be generally appreciated. (28) Several Bills considered in part last session will be revived by resolution, and, where necessary new amendments will be added. Among other matters engaging the serious attention of Ministers, and upon which it is intended at a later date to make proposals of an important character, that of Defence (29) is specially deserving of reconsideration, particularly in- view of recent developments. Short Bills relating to the Law of Evidence (30) ; Audit Act Amendment (31) ; Wireless Telegraphy (32); Census and Statistics (33) ; Weights and Measures (34) ; Designs (35); and Property Acquisition (36) will be placed before you. This list of subjects 'may be divided into two parts. The first is made up of minor Bills, aiming at useful but independent additions to the ordinary machinery of Government. The other consists of major Bills, embodying a progressive policy of development of the resources of the Commonwealth, intended to be carried out by systematic effort here and in the Mother Country, and, if necessary, in the sister dominions of the Empire. 

##### Mr McCay:

--  Is all that to be done this session ? 

##### Mr DEAKIN:

-- It may not be possible to complete this programme, though with the help of Parliament a great advance can be made before the next recess. The policy as a whole can be pushed far onward if we are able to follow a business-like session this year with a longer session next year, devoted to questions of the first magnitude, approached steadily and consistently from the practical side. At all events, so far as Ministers are concerned, this Parliament will be afforded, as it has itself demanded, another opportunity of fulfilling the purposes for which it was .elected, and justifying the confidence of those who look to us to foster the national interests of Australia. 

Honorable Members.  -  Hear, hear. 

##### Mr REID:<br><small class="text-muted">East Sydney</small>

-- When the honorable member for Bland was Prime Minister, and made a similar statement under cover of a motion for the printing of a paper, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat asked for an adjournment of the debate, which was granted. When I delivered a statement of a similar kind on a motion for the "printing of a paper, the honorable, member for Bland, as leader of the Opposition, applied for an adjournment until the next day, and I had no hesitation in complying with his request. Following that precedent, I should like to have an adjournment until to-morrow in order to consider the Ministerial statement. The Prime Minister has referred only inferential Iv to a large number of matters which will require serious consideration. 

##### Mr DEAKIN:

-- Of course, it would be impossible, even if we so desired, to refuse the right honorable gentleman the courtesy for which he asks. There is no wish on our part to restrict the criticisms of honorable members, our only anxiety being that no further delay or postponement shall be asked for in connexion with this debate) but that we shall proceed with it to-morrow, and conclude it as rapidly as possible. 

Debate (on motion by  **Mr. Reid)**  adjourned. 

House adjourned at 2.55 p.m.
