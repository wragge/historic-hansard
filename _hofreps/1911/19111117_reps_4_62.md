### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-0-0}
#### QUEENSLAND IMMIGRATION

##### Mr BAMFORD:<br><small class="text-muted">HERBERT, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- I wish to know from the Minister of External Affairs if the following report of remarks alleged to  have been made by him yesterday, appearing in this morning's  *Argus,*  is correct : ' - 

  >Queensland is full up. This great continent is crying  out for people, and there are not snips enough to carry those who want to come, yet Queensland has actually asked that agricultural immigrants from Russian Siberia should be warned off. The Russian Consul in Melbourne waited on me to-day concerning some of these immigrants. He stated that the Consul in Brisbane had been informed by the Queensland Government that the immigration depots were full, and had been asked to stay the immigrants from Russia and Siberia. 

If it is correct, I should like to know what the honorable gentleman means by the expression that Queensland is " full up." Does he mean that the State has as many immigrants as it can assimilate, or does he mean that it is " full up " of immigrants in the sense in which I anight use the word if I said that I am " full up " of the -Victorian election? 

##### Mr THOMAS:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for External Affairs &middot; BARRIER, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- The statement in the  *Argus*  is correct with this exception, that it was the Vice-Consul and not the Con sul for Russia who called on me. He informed me that a number of Russian immigrants have been going to Queensland for some time past, but that the Consul there has been notified by the State Government that, as the immigration depdts are required for immigrants coming from Great Britain, it would be glad if he would take steps to prevent further immigrants coming from Siberia. 

##### Mr Groom:

--  The statement that Queensland is " full up " of immigrants is hardly correct. 

##### Mr Page:

-- It is. " full up " of Russians. That is what is the matter. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- I understood that the State, having made arrangements for immigrants from the ' United Kingdom, did not desire any more from Siberia. Those who come from Siberia pay their own fares, and do not put the country, to any expense, and yet they have been asked by the State not to come. 

##### Mr DEAKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">BALLAARAT, VICTORIA</small>

-- May I invite the attention of the Minister to the golden opportunity which now offers for the Commonwealth to step forward pointing out that large parts of the Northern Territory possess in great measure the resources and advantages of Queensland, and that there is room there for tens of thousands of suitable settlers, if they will come? 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- I told the ViceConsul that if two Russians from Queensland: could be selected, I would make arrangements for them to visit the Northern Territory to sp.y out the land, with a view to .getting as uri any Russians as would come to settle there.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-1-0}
#### WATCHMAN ROSS

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- Some days ago I asked the Minister of Home. Affairs to lay on the table the papers connected with the appointment of Watchman Ross. I now have the papers, but they do not disclose the cause of the appointment. ' Will the Minister obtain from, the Director-General of Works, and lay-bn the table, a statement of the reasons of the appointment? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Home Affairs &middot; DARWIN, TASMANIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- T - The man was appointed because we wished to protect the Commonwealth property for which we are responsible. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- I desire the Minister to lay on the table a' statement from the Director-General  of Works as to the reasons for the appointment. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">PARRAMATTA, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Does" the Minister wish to convey to the House that the ordinary police protection is not sufficient, and that the poor fellow Ross had to be put on to watch the police and the building?. 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:

-- As As Minister of Home Affairs, I am responsible for the. protection of the property of the Commonwealth, and when there is  ,£25,000.  or  .£30,000  worth of property, it is going to be watched, even though some members of the Opposition desire to make capital out of the fact that I am, looking after these properties, not as they wish me to do, but as I think proper. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- The Minister has misunderstood the request of the honorable  member for Richmond. He has asked if the Minister will lay on the table the papers relating to the appointment, giving particulars as to the vacancy created, the applications sent in, and the reasons for the appointment which was made? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:

-- T - The honorable member for Richmond asked to have the papers laid on the table of the Library, and they were laid there - every paper connected with  **Mr. Ross'**  appointment. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- There is nothing about the appointment. 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:

-- Eve Every paper connected with  **Mr. Ross**  is there. No member of the Opposition is going to run the Department of Home Affairs while I am Minister. When members of the Opposition become Ministers, they can take advice, and no doubt will do as their officials tell them, but that is not my plan. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- The Minister promised me that he would lay on the table of the House the papers connected with the appointment. 

##### Mr King O'malley:

-- O -  On the table of the Library. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- My statement 'is virtually correct. Will the honorable gentleman fulfil his promise, and lay on the table of the House all the papers connected with the appointment of Watchman Ross ? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:

-- The The honorable member asked for the papers connected with the appointment of Ross, and they were all laid on the table, every paper in the Home Affairs Department. That is what he got, ' and he will get nothing more. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- There is nothing in the papers about the appointment. 

DRYSDALE li ATTERY. 

##### Mr OZANNE:<br><small class="text-muted">CORIO, VICTORIA</small>

-- Will the Minister representing the Minister of Defence lay on the table the papers relating to the disbanding of the Drysdale battery? I wish to know why it was disbanded ? 

##### Mr ROBERTS:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister (without portfolio) &middot; ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- I shall ask the Minister to supply the information.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-2-0}
#### QUEENSLAND QUARANTINE

##### Mr BAMFORD:

-- The sum of  .£1,200  is set down for the provision of quarantine accommodation' in Queensland. In view of the fact that ship passengers had recently to be brought all the way from Thursday Island to Sydney because of an outbreak of an epidemic, is it the intention of the Government to spend the money in providing quarantine accommodation in Northern Queensland, or is the station at Moreton Bay to be enlarged and added to? 

##### Mr TUDOR:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; YARRA, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- Inquiries are being made as to the best place for a quarantine station in Queensland. We are waiting for the report of the Director of Quarantine before spending any money. 

##### Mr FINLAYSON:<br><small class="text-muted">BRISBANE, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Will the Minister, see what can be done for the removal of the leper station from Peel Island, Moreton Bay, to whatever new quarantine station is created ? 

##### Mr Fowler:

--  Surely not. 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- The control of lepers is wholly a State matter. I do not know that what the honorable member asks is possible, but I ' shall inquire into the subject.

### PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; WIDE BAY, QUEENSLAND &middot; ALP</small>

-- I wish to give notice that I intend to ask this afternoon for leave to move then a motion providing that hereafter on every sitting day, unless otherwise ordered, Government business shall take precedence of general business. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The Prime Minister can do that now. Is it the pleasure pf the House that leave be given? 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- I object. There is no need for the motion before next Wednesday. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- The Prime Minister will remember that recently, when the afternoon usually devoted to private members' business was taken for Government business, he promised to give the time back later in the session. In view of the state-* ment just made, I ask if he intends to redeem that promise? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- What I said was that the time taken would be given back later in the same day, but the Opposition, in the exercise of its undoubted rights, occupied the whole day in the discussion of Government business. 

##### Mr W ELLIOT JOHNSON:<br><small class="text-muted">LANG, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; FT; ANTI-SOC from 1906; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917</small>

-- It was the Ministerialists who took up most of the time. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- At any rate, a day will be made available for private members' business before the session closes.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-5-0}
#### LITHGOW IRON INDUSTRY

##### Mr CANN:<br><small class="text-muted">NEPEAN, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the Minister of Trade and Customs yet received from the Royal Commissioner/Mr. Paull, his report on the iron bounty question? If so, will he lay it on the table of the House? 

##### Mr TUDOR:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I shall lay it on the table as soon as the questions without notice have been dealt with. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- Has a report been received from a Royal Commission appointed by the Commonwealth? 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- No special Royal Commission was appointed by the Commonwealth Government.  **Mr. Paull,**  and  **Mr. Smith,**  an auditor, were appointed as " approved persons " under the Manufactures Encouragement Act. They have submitted a report, and that is the document which I intend to lay upon the table, and I shall move for its printing. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- Does the Minister say that that report is not the same as the report of the Royal Commission to be presented to the State Government? 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- It is not. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- Then has the honorable member a copy of that report? 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- I have. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- Then will the honorable member lay it upon the table of the House, as it is very important? 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- The report of the Royal Commission of New South Wales is a purely State matter, and, so far as I know, it is not usual to lay State documents on the table of this House. I could obtain a number of copies from the State Government for honorable members to see. 

##### Mr Groom:

-- I thought the honorable member promised the honorable member for. Nepean to lay that report on the table? 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- I was referring to a different report altogether.

{: type="1" start="3"}
0. If not, is there any other reason for displacing  **Mr. Topp**  ? 
1. When is the report expected by the Minister? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follow : - 1 to 3. In view of the fact that the report submitted may be either adopted or referred back to the Commissioners by Parliament to  propose a fresh distribution it is highly inadvisable that any Commissioner should be absent until the redistribution is finally determined. 

It is not considered desirable to disturb the arrangements which I have already indicated. 

{: type="1" start="4"}
0. It is anticipated that the report will be submitted to Parliament for consideration early in the next session.
