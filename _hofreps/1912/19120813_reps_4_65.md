### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-0-0}
#### PANAMA CANAL

##### Mr DEAKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">BALLAARAT, VICTORIA</small>

-- Will the Prime Minister, if he has not already done so, place himself in communication with the Mother Country in reference to a question which has the most vital interest for Australia in its future relations with the new and old world - I refer to the decision of the American Congress in regard to the Panama Canal, which appears in to-day's cablegrams. 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; WIDE BAY, QUEENSLAND &middot; ALP</small>

-- I have read, with much regret, the press report that the Senate of the United States has decided to take a course in regard to the Panama Canal which seems clearly at variance with the treaty between that country and Great Britain, and affects our interests. I do not think that this is the time to discuss the matter. This Government has already expressed the views of the Commonwealth to the Mother Country, and asked to be associated with it in any protest that might be made. What has happened since serves to emphasize the opinion then expressed. We wish to be publicly associated with the Mother Country in a protest against the action taken, and we indulge the hope that the matter may not end with the decision of Congress. 

##### Mr HIGGS:<br><small class="text-muted">CAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Does not the Prime Minister consider that, no matter what the United States Senate may do, the construction of the Panama Canal will be of extra ordinary advantage to the trade and commerce of Australia ? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- I do not think that the value of the Panama Canal is in question! As the Senate's decision affects treaty rights, it cannot very well be discussed here. This Government will congratulate any and every Government that may open up the waterways of the world, and promote commerce. Undoubtedly, whatever may happen, the opening of the Panama Canal will be an advantage.

### QUESTION

#### SUGAR INDUSTRY: WAGES

##### Mr DEAKIN:

-- I have received from the Chamber of Commerce, at Cairns, a telegram in which it is stated that the new regulations appeared in the local news columns, were at once enforced, without regard to existing arrangements between labourers and. farmers, and that the bounty is withheld from farmers who were unaware that the new conditions existed. My correspondent says that the local Customs officers are unable to inform the farmers whether the regulations are applicable to both harvesting and ordinary work, and that, consequently, there is confusion among the labourers, and dismay amongst farmers. Will the Minister tell us how he proposes to end this confusion ? 

##### Mr TUDOR:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; YARRA, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- Agreements entered into between employers and employes, as a body, stand good. 

##### Mr Deakin:

--  That does not appear to be understood. 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- The statement was made definitely when the regulations were pubished on the  2nd  August. The rates that have been fixed are being paid in several districts now. What is proposed is that the bounty should be withheld until the case is submitted to arbitration. 

##### Mr Deakin:

--  Will the honorable member see that the local Customs officers are better informed? 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- They have been informed.

#### SYDNEY GOVERNMENT HOUSE

##### Mr FULLER:<br><small class="text-muted">ILLAWARRA, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Did the Prime Minister, during his recent conference with the Premier of New South Wales, come to  a  definite arrangement regarding the occupation of the State Government House at Sydney? If so, what are the terms of it? 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I am not in a position to give the terms. An understanding was arrived at which I think will be mutually, satisfactory to the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, and to the Governor-General. As soon as I am in a position to make a statement, I shall do so with pleasure. 

##### Mr MATHEWS:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE PORTS, VICTORIA</small>

-- After the conference with the Premier of New South Wales, when the possibility of a charge being made for Government House, Sydney, was made public, was the right honorable gentleman approached by the Premier of Victoria and asked for payment for this building and Government House? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- No. I hope that nothing that has been done in my negotiations with the Premier of New South Wales will involve any application from Victoria.

#### DAY LABOUR

##### Mr RICHARD FOSTER:<br><small class="text-muted">WAKEFIELD, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; ANTI-SOC; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917; LP from 1922; NAT from 1925</small>

-- Will the Prime Minister supplement his statement of Thursday night last by laying on the table copies of reports by inspectors and other responsible officers upon the labour employed on the undergrounding work of the Telephone Department? 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- Speaking quite frankly, I think it undesirable that reports from engineers and other works officers should be laid on the table. 

##### Mr RICHARD FOSTER:<br><small class="text-muted">WAKEFIELD, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; ANTI-SOC; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917; LP from 1922; NAT from 1925</small>

--  I asked for copies of them. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- I do not think that copies of them should be laid on the table. The charges made were not sustained. 

##### Mr BRUCE SMITH:<br><small class="text-muted">PARKES, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; FT; ANTI-SOC from 1906; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917</small>

-- By whom have *he statements of " the man-on-the-job "  *been*  disposed of? If they have been settled by a report, will the Prime Minister Jay it on the table? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- The charges of "the  Bian-on-the-job  " were not sustained, and the matter has been effectively settled. 

##### Mr FULLER:

-- I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he considers the complaints made in respect of " the man- on-the-job " were disposed of by him reading to the House an unsigned report, and whether he will produce the signed report upon which he bases his claim that the matter has been settled? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- I do not propose to lay departmental documents on the table unless something fresh is brought forward which requires an answer. 

##### Mr Fuller:

--  Does not the right honorable gentleman think that the charges made demand an answer? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- -The report came from the departmental officers to me. I do not preside over the Department, and until new matter is forthcoming I decline to lay anything more on the table of the House. 

##### Mr FULLER:

-- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he definitely refuses to supply us with the name of the officer who furnished the unsigned report which he read to the House, and, if so, what is his reason for taking up that attitude? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- The report reached me with a covering letter from the Deputy Postmaster-General, Mi. Bright. Thai fact in itself constitutes ample authority for any Minister laying it upon the table. 


 *Later:* 


##### Mr FULLER:

-- Following up the question which I have already put to the Prime Minister, I direct his attention to the fact that he is reported in  *Hansard*  to have said on the 8th August - 

  >The statements in the  *Argus*  of 31st July are dealt with separately in the order in which they appeared. The Acting Electrical Engineer submits this report : - " I submit herewith reports from the respon sible officers in connexion with the various criticisms in the press." 

I wish to know whether the Prime Minister will give the names of responsible officers to whose reports he referred? 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The covering letter was from  **Mr. Bright, Deputy**  Postmaster^ General of Victoria. If the reports are challenged as being incorrect or " faked," that is another matter. I do not propose" to submit the reports. 

##### Mr FULLER:

-- We do not want the reports, but the names of the officers. Am I to understand that the Prime Minister definitely refuses "to give to thi* 

House the names of the officers whose reports in connexion with this matter have been furnished? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- I submitted to the House, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, the reports furnished under cover of a letter from the Deputy PostmasterGeneral of Victoria. I rely upon that absolutely, and think it is sufficient.

#### QUARANTINE

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether, in order to save the shipping companies a large expenditure, and also to shorten the period of quarantine, anything has been done to intercept the vessel upon which there- is an outbreak of small-pox ? 

##### Mr TUDOR:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I presume that the honorable member refers to the steam-ship  *Montoro.*  A case of small-pox has occurred on that vessel, and the patient was landed at Sourabaya. The Department endeavoured to get into touch with the steamer with a view to intercepting her at Thursday Island. The agents desired the vessel to proceed to Sydney, but instructions have been issued that her Queensland passengers are not to be carried beyond Brisbane. They are to be landed there. The Brisbane station is in a fit state to. accommodate them, and only passengers for New South Wales and more southern ports will be brought on from there.

#### ELECTORAL DIVISIONS: NEW SOUTH WALES

##### Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN:<br><small class="text-muted">EDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I wish to ask the Minister of Home Affairs when we are likely to have the scheme for the electoral redistribution of New South Wales before us? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Home Affairs &middot; DARWIN, TASMANIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- We are now assured that we shall have it on the 30th inst. 

##### Mr THOMAS BROWN:<br><small class="text-muted">CALARE, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I desire to ask' the Minister whether it is a fact, as ~ reported in the press, that the Queensland Commissioners have completed their second redistribution of that State into electoral divisions, and, if so, what is the reason for the delay in the New South Wales Commissioners presenting their first report to this House? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:

-- The delay is caused by the fact that the printing office of that State is overworked. The people of 

New South Wales are so prosperous, and everything in that State is booming so much, that we are compelled to wait until the report of the Commissioners reaches us. It has, however, been promised for the 30th inst.

#### DEFENCE

Australian Garrison Artillery: Prosecution of Cadets

##### Mr RYRIE:<br><small class="text-muted">NORTH SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence if he can say why warrant officers, sergeant-majors, and sergeants of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery have not participated in the increase of pay which has been granted to those ranks in every other branch of the service? 

##### Mr ROBERTS:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister (without portfolio) &middot; ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- I am not at present in a position to say whether the officers mentioned have not participated in the increase of pay granted to other branches of the service, as alleged by the honorable member, but I will obtain the information. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, without notice, whether cadets whom it is desired to punish for non-attendance at drill could not be proceeded against under the First Offenders Act? 

##### Mr ROBERTS:

-- It is thought that the action which we have taken to reduce the fines, and to permit all the cadets who have offended to make up the necessary time, will meet the case referred to by the honorable member.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-8-0}
#### KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA RAILWAY

##### Mr FOWLER:<br><small class="text-muted">PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs a question arising out of a reference contained in the Perth  *Sunday Times*  of 28th July last to the shortening of the route of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway immediately east' of Kalgoorlie. The paragraph in question reads - 

  >As a matter of fact, when the question _ of the site of the work-shops was first engaging attention at Kalgoorlie it was the Crown Surveyor, Fred Casey, who impressed on Mayor Cutbush the feasibility of the distanceshortening plan, and blew the hopes of the merry gentleman of  Kuramia  sky high, as it were. Mayor Cutbush expatiated on the improved route at the public meeting, armed with Casey's figures and estimates, before Chinn had ever said a word about it. 

In view of the importance of his statements as to the reputation of the engineer in charge of the Western Australian section of the transcontinental line, will the Minister make inquiries as to whether the mayor and the town surveyor of Kalgoorlie took the idea of this improvement from  **Mr. Chinn,**  or  **Mr. Chinn**  took it from those gentlemen? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I am very much obliged to the honorable member for having produced such splendid evidence in support of the great ability of  **Mr. Chinn,**  because they are all in it, and we are only too delighted that we have been able to shorten the route by five miles, and thus save  ,£20,000. 

##### Mr KELLY:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Will the Minister inform the House who are the persons who are " all in it," and what is it that they are " all in " ? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:

-- They are all concerned in the shortening of the route of the line, according to the honorable member for Perth. If the town surveyor of Kalgoorlie and  **Mr Cutbush,**  the mayor of that city, produced this evidence, in the first instance, and if  **Mr. Chinn**  was the third party to it, and if I were the fourth, well, we are all in it.

{:#subdebate-9-0}
#### COMMONWEALTH AND UNITED STATES

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been called to a statement in the  *Age*  of yesterday, in which a member of the House of Commons in Canada, who is also the owner of a very large newspaper, expressed the following opinion : - 

  >If Germany is successful in invading England, nothing will keep her out of the United States, although Canada might be the first objective. It is time for thought, maybe for prayer - certainly for action. 

I also desire to ask whether the Prime Minister will take any precautions that may be necessary to support the Home land in any trouble, and also to make for as much peace as possible with the United States by refusing to acquiesce in any suggestion which might provoke friction? 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The Commonwealth Government have partly anticipated action -of that kind by three years at least. Whilst I do not attach the same importance to the language to which the honorable member has drawn attention as some others do, we all know that the hon orable member for Ballarat and the Government of which he was the head took an important step three years ago to cultivate the friendship of the United States of America. This Government wishes to cultivate the friendship of all friendly and peace-loving nations. Whilst we do that, I am not one of those who live in trepidation of what will happen if any nation, or combination of nations, attacks the Empire to which we belong.

#### TOCUMWAL POST-OFFICE

##### Mr CHANTER:<br><small class="text-muted">RIVERINA, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs, without notice, what is the nature and extent of the additions and repairs to the post-office at Tocumwal, and, also, when the work is to be commenced and when completed? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The following items are included in the proposed work at the Tocumwal Post-office: - Extension of office, new telephone exchange, telephone cabinet, extension of porch, minor alterations, painting, and repairs. Tenders were called for this work during the last financial year, but the lowest offer received exceeded the amount available. Funds have been provided, however, on the Draft Estimates for  1912-13,  and arrangements will be made to commence the work as soon as the money has been voted by Parliament. It is estimated that the work will take about twelve weeks to carry out.

#### GOVERNMENT BRICKWORKS

##### Mr BRUCE SMITH:<br><small class="text-muted">PARKES, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; FT; ANTI-SOC from 1906; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917</small>

-- I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs, without notice, whether he is aware that the Minister of Public Works, New South Wales, recently found fault with the price charged for bricks, and established a brick industry on behalf of the Government, promising to supply the public with bricks at  *£1*  per  1,000?  Is the Minister also aware that the Minister of Public Works referred to has been charging  £3  per I, 000 for bricks, which is a higher price than private enterprise is asking ? If he is not aware of these facts, will the Minister look into them before starting any brick industry in connexion with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway ? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- We d'd not intend to start a brick industry in connexion with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. We do intend to start one in connexion with the Federal Capital. I am very sorry to hear the honorable member's statement that the Minister of Public Works in New South Wales made a miscalculation. 

##### Mr FAIRBAIRN:<br><small class="text-muted">FAWKNER, VICTORIA</small>

-- Is the Minister of Home Affairs aware that some time ago the Victorian Government started brickworks, and that the affair " burst up " altogether? 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:

-- I was not aware that the Victorian Government started brickworks. I know that the late  **Sir Thomas**  Bent, while Premier of that State, talked of doing so ; but I did not think that he carried out his intention.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-12-0}
#### PRIVILEGE- THE AGE NEWSPAPER

##### Mr RILEY:<br><small class="text-muted">South Sydney</small>

-- A notice of motion stands in my name to the effect that the representatives of the  *Age*  newspaper should be excluded from the press galleries of this House until such time as an apology is made for misrepresentation. I gave notice of the motion when I was smarting under what I thought to be a grave injustice. Since that time, the journal in question has apologized through its columns. The matter of which I complained appears to have been inserted in consequence of a mistake. Since I arrived in Melbourne to-day I have also had an interview with a representative of the newspaper, and can plainly see how the error crept in. As the mistake was committed unintentionally, I have to request that I have leave to withdraw the motion. 

##### Mr RYRIE:<br><small class="text-muted">North Sydney</small>

.- On the question of privilege, I wish to know whether I am not, as well as the honorable member for South Sydney, entitled to an apology from the  *Age*  newspaper? That journal has called me alazy member. 

##### Mr Fenton:

--  That is what the honorable member said he was. 

##### Mr RYRIE:

-- I never said that I was a lazy member. I said that I did not like work; but if I do work, not liking it, I cannot be said to be lazy. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Do I understand that the honorable member objects to the withdrawal of the motion? 

##### Mr RYRIE:

-- No,  **Mr. Speaker;**  but surely there is nothing to prevent me from submitting a similar motion on my own account. I, as well as the honorable member for South Sydney, want an apology from the  *Age.* 

Motion, by leave, withdrawn.

#### POSTAL COMMISSION'S REPORT

##### Mr WATKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">for Mr. Webster</small>

asked the Postmaster-General,  *upon notice*  - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. Whether it is the intention of the Minister to give effect to Recommendation No. 165 of Postal Commission's Report? 
1. Will the Minister seriously consider the necessity of giving effect to Recommendation No. 26 of Postal Commission's Report? 

##### Mr THOMAS:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for External Affairs &middot; BARRIER, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- The answers to the honorable member's questions are - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. It is proposed to erect a new General Postoffice at Perth, in the vicinity of the Railway Station. 
1. Yes. 


 **Mr. WATKINS** (for  **Mr. Webster)**  asked the Postmaster-General,  *upon notice -* 

  >Whether he intends to adopt the first paragraph of Recommendation No. 45 of Postal Commission's Report ? 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- This matter has been considered by two Conferences of  Deputy  Postmasters-General. It was reported that the expenditure incurred in sorting English mails between Fremantle and Adelaide would be very much greater than if done on the trains, and that the only advantage to be gained, even when the weather permitted the proper sorting of the mails between those places, would be a slightly earlier delivery in Adelaide, the sorting on trains giving quite as expeditious and satisfactory a service as could be gained by sorting at sea.

#### PUBLIC SERVICE: OVERTIME

##### Mr WATKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">for Mr. Page</small>

asked the Minister of Home Affairs,  *upon notice -* 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. Is it correct, as stated in the Melbourne  *Herald,*  that the Public Service regulations provide that overtime shall be paid at the rate  *of*  time and a quarter, that officers of the Federal Treasury and of other Departments, whose usual hours are thirty-six and threequarters a week, are required to work fortyfour hours before they can claim overtime, and that when they do claim overtime, the payment for the latter is based on a forty-eight hour week, which reduces the overtime payment below that for work in the ordinary hours? 
1. Will the Minister see that, if overtime has tobe worked, it is paid for at a rate higher than that for work in ordinary hours. 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The answers to the honorable member's questions are - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. Officers of all Divisions of the Public Service who are wholly or in greater part employed on indoor duties are required to work forty-four hours per week before overtime payment can be claimed. Payment for overtime is made at the rate of time and a quarter based on a day of eight hours. This is slightly lower than the hourly payment computed on a week of thirty-six and three-quarter hours, but overtime computed on the above hours, which are the minimum number per week, is not considered equitable. Officers have always been required to work extra time daily before being entitled to claim overtime, and on the weekly limit fixed, namely, forty-four hours, the payment per hour for overtime is not less than that received per hour for ordinary work. 
1. No alteration in the present rates is deemed advisable.
