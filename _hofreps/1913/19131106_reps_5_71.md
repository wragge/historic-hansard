### POSITION OP MR. SPEAKER

##### Mr THOMAS:<br><small class="text-muted">Barrier</small>

.- I give notice that to-morrow I shall move - 

  >That in view of the following words -  "In the circumstances I directed the  Clerk  to carry out the decision of the House, and to read the Bill a third time before I put the motion,' being added by the Honorable the  Speaker  to the  *Hansard*  report of his statement on the point of order raised by the honorable member for Kennedy, on 30th October  *[Hansard,*  page 2789), and in view of his voting for the closure of the debate when his right to vote in Committee was being discussed, the  Speaker  has lost- 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I cannot accept the notice of motion, which is out of order, because it deals with a matter that has already been determined by the House, and also with something that took place in Committee, with which the House has no concern. 

##### Mr Thomas:

--  Do I understand that no member can give notice of a motion affirming that the  Speaker  has lost the confidence of the House ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I rule that the notice of motion which the honorable member was reading is out of order. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- Then I give notice that to-morrow I shall move that  **Mr. Speaker**  has lost the esteem, the respect, and the confidence of this House. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

--  I submit,  **Mr. Speaker,**  that you ought to repudiate the terms of the motion of which notice has been given, as they are an insult to you. If the honorable member for Barrier wishes to challenge the actions of the  Speaker,  he should do so in respectful language. I submit that the terms of his notice of motion are insulting. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I have not seen the notice of motion in writing, and do not know what its terms will be. The honorable member has only indicated what he intends to do. I know nothing beyond that.

### NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">Wide Bay</small>

.- I give notice that to-morrow I shall move - 

  >That the Government does not possess the confidence of this House. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

--  This is the third motion of censure this session. 

##### Mr Riley:

--  No, the second. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

--  My impression is that it is the third. I ask my right honorable friend, purely and simply in the interests of public business, whether there in any prospect of an understanding being arrived at as to the length of time which the discussion of the motion will take? 

##### Mr Fisher:

--  It will be very reasonable. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

--  What does the right honorable member mean by "reasonable." Will it finish this week? 

##### Mr Webster:

--  Does the Prime Minister want to dictate everything? 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

--  I am talking to the honorable member's leader now, if he does not mind! Is there any possibility of finishing the debate this week! 

##### Mr Fisher:

--  The honorable member means to-morrow? I think not. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-Then early next week! 

##### Mr Fisher:

--  Yes. 

##### Mr Thomas:

--  I would not make any promise at all. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

--  I shall be glad if the right honorable member will consult his colleagues, who seem - to put it vulgarly - to be "running this show." 

##### Mr McDonald:

--  The Attorney-General is running the Prime Minister.

### ADJOURNMENT

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs &middot; Parramatta &middot; LP</small>

--  I move - 

  >That the House do now adjourn. 

##### Mr Fisher:

--  **Mr. Speaker** 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I have not yet stated the question. 

##### Mr Fisher:

--  You,  **Mr. Speaker,**  allowed the Prime Minister to interrogate me without the leave of the House, in impertinent and even in vulgar terms, and I desire to make a personal explanation. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

--  I rise to a point of order. I require the right honorable member to withdraw his insulting observation that I was vulgar and insulting.. I was nothing of the kind. I am conscious only of having addressed a reasonable inquiry to him. Certainly I had no intention of insulting him, or of being vulgar. 

##### Mr Fisher:

--  After the explanation of the Prime Minister, I withdraw what I said. He certainly interrogated me again and again after I had given him an answer. 

##### Mr McWilliams:

--  Why not suspend the Standing Orders, and go on now ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The question is thai the House do now adjourn. The honorable member for Wide Bay- 

##### Mr Fisher:

--  I have nothing to add.. I only wished to protest against the. manner and language of the Prime Minister. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

House adjourned at 2.40 p.m.
