### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-0-0}
#### DEFENCE ACT AMENDMENT

Cadets

##### Mr WATKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">NEWCASTLE, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether, in view of the hardship which is caused throughout Australia by some of the provisions of the Defence Act relating to cadets, he can say when the Government intends to introduce an amending Bill to allow the sons of widows who are the sole support of their mothers exemption from drill? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Home Affairs &middot; PARRAMATTA, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP</small>

-- I shall be glad if the honorable member will give notice of the question; I am not prepared to answer it at once. It raises a series of very important considerations, and will require to be looked into most carefully.

#### POLICE AND GENERAL ELECTIONS

##### Mr KELLY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister (without portfolio) &middot; WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP</small>

-- Some time ago the honorable member for Maribyrnong asked me a question regarding the payment made to officers of the police force for services rendered during the recent election. The Chief Electoral Officer reports - 

  >In connexion with the elections in 1910, the police acted as doorkeepers at the larger polling booths, and those who were engaged received 10s. each from the Divisional Returning Officers. In connexion with the referendums, 1911, the police authorities in Victoria objected to constables acting as doorkeepers, but agreed to those who were doing ordinary police duty at the booths receiving a meal allowance of 2s. 6d. each, which was paid through the Police Department. A similar arrangement was observed in connexion with the last elections. The payment of such meal allowance has to be made through police authorities, who have not yet submitted their account, but it is expected in the next few days.

#### SMALL-POX OUTBREAK

##### Mr TUDOR:<br><small class="text-muted">YARRA, VICTORIA</small>

-- I wish to know whether the Government has decided to reimburse the Government of New South Wales all the expenditure incurred in the active quarantine in that State during the recent small-pox outbreak? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">LP</small>

-- I do not know what is being done.

### WESTERN ELECTRICAL COMPANY

##### Mr FRAZER:<br><small class="text-muted">KALGOORLIE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I desire to make a personal explanation. In a newspaper, published in Melbourne, yesterday there is a letter signed by  **Mr. Hungerford,**  the general manager of the Western Electrical Company of Australia Limited. He makes the statement that I am reported to have said that the company deliberately swindled the Commonwealth out of £5,900, that action was taken, and that the whole amount was recovered by the Commonwealth. I say that that is absolutely true. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member is entitled to read the extracts in connexion with a personal explanation. 

##### Mr FRAZER:

-- The company deliberately swindled the Commonwealth out of £5,900. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

--  Surely this is not a personal explanation. 

##### Mr FRAZER:

-- It is a personal explanation, because an attack has been made on me. The company kept the sum that I have mentioned in a suspense account for about five years before distributing it among its shareholders, its excuse being, when the facts were made known by its late accountant giving information to the Department, that it had not been called' on to pay the money. The ex-Prime Minister knows that I asked him to call for a special report upon the matter from the Auditor-General, which was done.  **Mr. Hungerford**  says that eventually a claim was made, which the company found to its surprise that the departmental officers were unable to substantiate in any way from their records; but, although the company was under no obligation to assist the Department, it placed its books and records at the disposal of the officials, and after they had satisfied themselves as to the amount they considered to be due, the company paid it. Those statements are quite true, but the company knew that the Minister of Trade and Customs had the power to take its books if the company had not placed them at our disposal. The Commonwealth owes the company nothing, so far as that is concerned. I certainly intended to have the books taken from the company if they were not made available to the Department.  **Mr. Hungerford**  also says that if the conduct of the company had been as I asserted, I should have initiated a prosecution against it, and that the company would have gladly availed itself of  the opportunity to have the facts publicly sifted. I tell  **Mr. Hungerford**  that I took counsel's advice, and was informed that, while there was no doubt that a criminal act had been committed, it was doubtful whether, under the circumstances, a jury could be got to convict.  **Mr. Hungerford**  can take that statement with my compliments. I placed an embargo on the company, saying that I would not deal with thieves, and that it was not to be considered as a tenderer for Commonwealth supplies during my terra of office. This Government has lifted that embargo. 

##### Mr AGAR WYNNE:<br><small class="text-muted">Postmaster-General &middot; BALACLAVA, VICTORIA &middot; LP</small>

-- I did not intend to reply to the honorable member if he had not concluded his remarks by saying, " This Government are to blame for lifting it." 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Does the Minister desire to make a personal explanation ? 

##### Mr AGAR WYNNE:

-- I do; but I wish to go a little further and explain the facts, and for that purpose I ask that I may be given leave to make a statement. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- It is not in order to reply to a personal explanation, but if the Minister desires to make a statement to the House. I ask : Is it the pleasure of the House that the Postmaster-General have leave to make a statement? 

Honorable Members .  - Hear, hear. 

##### Mr AGAR WYNNE:

-- When tenders were called for the supply of certain goods to the Department, one of the conditions was that if there was any increase in the duty, the Department was to pay the increased duties to the tenderer, and if there were any lowering of the duties, the tenderer was to be called upon to refund to the Department the amount of the duty overpaid. 

##### Sir Robert Best:

-- That is in accordance with the Customs laws. 

##### Mr AGAR WYNNE:

-- That is so. In this particular case the Department overlooked the fact that the Customs Act contained this provision, and did not call upon the company referred to, and nine other tenderers for the sale of goods to the Department, to refund duty overpaid. In this case the honorable thing for the firm in question would have been to have informed the Department that they had received this money in excess, but they were not legally bound to do so. In the majority of cases we have sharp business men to deal with, and they stand on their legal rights. When the Department, through the information given by the accountant who had left the employ of these people, called upon them to refund the duty overpaid, and the amount was fixed by an inspection of their books, they did refund the overpaid duty. In five other cases claims were thereupon made from other tenderers, in one instance for over £1,000, and in others for smaller sums. Some of the money has been repaid, but four companies have not yet paid up, and I have given instructions that legal proceedings be taken against them for the recovery of the overpaid duty. As a matter of fact, within the strict legal terms of the contract, it was the duty of the Department to call upon these people to refund the money. 

##### Mr Frazer:

-- But they knew they were keeping it wrongfully. 

##### Mr AGAR WYNNE:

-- As a strict matter of law they were entitled to retain it until they were asked to refund it. But what happened so far as the Department is concerned? When the company in question was debarred from tendering, and fresh tenders were sought from firms supplying similar goods, the best tender received was between £6,000 and £7,000 in excess of the prior tender by this company. In another case, I believe that the difference amounted to £12,000. 

##### Mr Bamford:

-- What percentage would that be ? 

##### Mr AGAR WYNNE:

-- It would be 25 per cent., probably. I found that the Department would be at a loss of probably £20,000 if I had continued the embargo on these people. It is our duty in this, as in every other Department of the Public Service, to watch these matters very carefully ourselves. We call for tenders, we have a standard, and it is our duty to protect ourselves, and see that we get what we are asking for. When the embargo was taken off this firm, the prices for the goods came down something like 20 or 25 per cent. Although in the circumstances this firm probably deserved some punishment for their sharp practice, though it might be characterized otherwise as looseness on our part, I was, by removing the embargo, saving the Department in connexion with two tenders alone probably £20,000.

### HANSARD PROOFS

##### Mr ROBERTS:<br><small class="text-muted">ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- Will you permit me to draw attention,  **Mr. Speaker,**  to the fact that this morning when I received proofs of the  *Hansard*  report of my remarks yesterday, I found that there had been taken out of them statements made by another member, to which I had replied. The other member may, conscientiously, and in keeping with the forms, correct the report of his remarks, andhis corrections, when made, may lead to the impression that my remarks have little or no sense or connexion. Would it. not be possible, under the circumstances, for members to have the privilege of seeing what is interpolated into the reports of their speeches, particularly when the interpolations are in the form of statements to which they have replied. 

##### Mr WEBSTER:<br><small class="text-muted">MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I may say that my speech is made wholly unintelligible by the omission from it of statements that were made during the time that I was on my feet. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I shall make inquiries of the Principal Parliamentary Reporter in regard to the matter. 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">WIDE BAY, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- May I ask you, sir, if it is a fact that you have given instructions that all your rulings are to be taken out of the proofs submitted to members ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Certainly. I claim the right of every honorable member of this House to see my uncorrected proofs before they are put into the hands of other honorable members. May I call attention to the danger which could arise from a wrong use of incorrect proofs, and which might affect any honorable member. If the uncorrected proofs of members' speeches are to be put into the hands of other honorable members, there will be no sense at all in any honorable member being permitted to revise the report of his speech, to correct errors, before it appears in  *Hansard,*  and if the uncorrected report of the Speaker's remarks is to go before other honorable members, the uncorrected reports of every member's speech may also go before other members. The  Speaker  should not be placed under a disability under which no other honorable member suffers. If the rough and uncorrected proofs, especially of important rulings, which may contain errors, coming from the hands of the printer, are to be put into the hands of other honorable members, then neither he nor any member of the House will be safe from subsequent misrepresentation. 

##### Mr ANSTEY:<br><small class="text-muted">BOURKE, VICTORIA</small>

-- A few mouths ago you gave a ruling with which I entirely agree. Upon that ruling I desire to ask you a question. Your ruling was to the effect that no honorable member had the right to see the uncorrected proof of another honorable member's speech. The question I desire to ask is : By what right, and by whose authority, the  *Hansard*  staff supplied you with an uncorrected proof of my utterances and replies to questions by you to me? Do you claim a right which is denied to other honorable members? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- In the hands of the  Speaker,  and in the hands of the  President,  the whole of this question of proofs really rests. I do not get the proofs of other honorable members' speeches, except in so far as they may raise questions upon which I have to intervene. 

##### Mr Anstey:

-- But uncorrected matter, sir? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! I have never received uncorrected proofs of other honorable members' speeches, nor have I ever sought to get them in the ordinary way, except where they have been included in my own proof sheets as relating to something in connexion with which I have had to intervene. It would be necessary in a case of that kind for me to see what happened immediately before I intervened that I might know whether my own report was correct. 

##### Mr Anstey:

-- You have seen uncorrected reports of my remarks. 

##### Mr Poynton:

-- The honorable member should be careful, or he will be turned out. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! For instance, an honorable member may raise a point of order, which I have to decide. I could not possibly decide the point of order without knowing what it was. Very often an interjection, or perhaps two or three, are interpolated by other honorable members altogether. These interjections could not be excised from the proofs. When I spoke of an honorable member not having the right to have access to another honorable member's uncorrected proofs, I wanted to say that in this matter it is my duty as  Speaker  to safeguard every honorable member of the House from the liability of his uncorrected proofs being brought in evidence against him when he has not an opportunity himself of revising them and correcting matter which may have erroneously got in, or may have been erroneously reported. In this connexion I may say that this is particularly necessary at the present time, because I have received an intimation that the  *Hansard*  Staff find it increasingly difficult to accurately report honorable members speeches, owing to the amount of interruptions that take place, and even their trained ears are not to be absolutely relied upon to give a faithful report of what has taken place in such circumstances. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- I should like to ask you, sir, one question : On this very important matter, have you departed from the custom of the past? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I have not departed, so far as I am aware, from what has been the practice all the time. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- My proof has been altered, I understand, by the direction of  **Mr. Speaker.**  If you, sir, did not do it, I hope that you will be good enough to tell us who did it, because nobody would act in such a matter without your authority. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- So far as I am aware I have given no instruction to alter anything in the proof of what the honorable member said. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- No, sir, but you have taken out several rulings of your own, which has altered the position. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- That is a different matter entirely.I have taken out matter of my own, but have not altered matter of the honorable member. That exactly brings me back to the point at which I started, and that is, that there is no reason why I should be placed under a disability which I would allow no other honorable member to lie under.

### PERSONAL EXPLANATION

Colonel RYRIE. - In regard to the proceedings of last night, I find that it is not made clear in the reports in the press, and in the minds of people, that in transgressing as I did - and I admit that I transgressed - I was subject to very great provocation. I want to make that clear. 


 **Colonel RYRIE.** - There were hurled at me epithets which would have incited any man to take the action which I did. I might, sir, draw your attention to this fact, that, although the honorable member for Melbourne Ports insisted that I should withdraw my statement before he withdrew his, after I voluntarily got up and withdrew my statement, he did not withdraw anything. 


 **Colonel RYRIE.** - The honorable member for Melbourne Ports insisted that I should get up first. There were a great many epithets hurled at me from round the Chamber which have never been withdrawn, and one in particular imputed cowardice to me. That, I think, was very unfair. I was even called a " damned scoundrel." according to the newspapers. I object to an epithet of that sort being hurled at me, because it is very unfair. I fail to see where the imputation of cowardice could have any weight. The honorable member for Maranoa, as big a man as myself, was very persistent with his epithets. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member must not refer to that. 

Colonel RYRIE.- I do not like to allow a charge of cowardice to rest on me. 

##### Mr Anstey:

-- If you want a demonstration, come upstairs. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! 

Colonel RYRIE.- I would like to have that matter set at rest quietly and dispassionately. I suggest to honorable members that if they would select six of the biggest or the best men they have, and come quietly- 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! 

Colonel RYRIE. - Let me finish my sentence. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! 

##### Mr Anstey:

-- Here you are, sir, I'm on ! 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! 

##### Mr Anstey:

-- Here you are ! 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order! 

##### Mr Anstey:

-- Here you are ! 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! Will the honorable member for Hunter be seated? 

##### Mr Charlton:

-- I want, sir, to take a point of order. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! Will honorable members maintain order? 

##### Mr Anstey:

-- Melbourne Ports- 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! Will the honorable member for Hunter be seated for a moment. Every day I have to make an appeal which it should not be necessary for the  Speaker  to make. My position is difficult enough ordinarily, in all conscience, as honorable members must admit. This continual interruption of the business by disorderly interjections, and by audible remarks all over the chamber, prevents me from hearing or knowing what is going on. The honorable member for Hunter, I understand, has risen to a point of order; but I have not been able to hear one word he has said on account of the interruption. This must cease, else I shall take other action. 

##### Mr Charlton:

--  I desire to ask,' sir, whether the honorable member for North Sydney, under cover of a personal explanation, is justified in this deliberative Assembly in asking that six honorable members from this side should go, one after the other, to meet him, so that he could deal with them. 

##### Mr Howe:

--  That is cowardice again. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- No. The honorable member for North Sydney, if he did say so, was certainly out of order. At the same time, I again emphasize the importance of honorable members remaining quiet so that I can hear what an honorable member is saying. Otherwise I am not able to intervene. The honorable member for North Sydney would not be in order in proceeding on those lines, because a personal explanation must relate to something in which he had been misrepresented or misunderstood, or to something that lie lias said which has not been made sufficiently clear. 

##### Mr Charlton:

--  I ask, sir, that the honorable member for North Sydney be called upon to withdraw the statement. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! I understand that the honorable member for North Sydney, in making a personal explanation, made some statement - I do not know what - which has been regarded as offensive. If he did so, I ask him to withdraw the statement. 

Colonel Ryrie.  -  One thing I omitted, sir, in my personal explanation was to draw your attention to the aggravation to which I was subjected. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order 1 Before the honorable member proceeds with his personal explanation, I ask him to withdraw the reflection, or something objectionable which he is stated to have said regarding other members. 

##### Mr McDonald:

--  It was a breach of the privileges of the House. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! I ask the honorable member to withdraw any offensive remarks before he proceeds. 


 **Colonel RYRIE.** - Very well, sir,  I  withdraw any offensive remarks, but honorable members did not know whether I was going to ask them to come and have a cup of tea or not. My complaint, sir, is that the epithets " hangman " and " executioner " were hurled at me, and in the circumstances I think that the provocation was very great. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I certainly understood that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports did withdraw the words he had used - that was my impression. But if the honorable member for North Sydney knew that words of an offensive character had not been withdrawn by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, the time for him to draw my attention to the fact was then, and not now. The question cannot now be raised.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-6-0}
#### HANSARD PROOFS

##### Mr WEBSTER:

-- I wish to ask you, sir, some questions regarding the elimination of certain remarks of yours from the proofs of other members' speeches. Firsts has such a custom been adopted by any predecessor of yours ? Second, are you aware that honorable members are allowed a certain number of copies of their proofs to be forwarded to those whom they may deem it advisable to send them to, and the proofs, mutilated as they are to-day, would be totally useless and defeat the privilege which is allowed to honorable members ? Hence we are put under a disability, which I am sure you will not desire us to be under when you realize the effect of your action. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- In regard to the first question, I do not think that in the history of this or any other Parliament there is a precedent for the proceedings which have taken place so far as the Speaker's intervention is concerned. In this case, amidst great scenes of disorder, tumult at times, the  Speaker  is called on suddenly to give a ruling or to interpose in relation to some matter that has come up- 

##### Mr Fisher:

--  I object. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Which involves him making a statement. 

##### Mr Fisher:

--  I protest against such a statement from the Chair. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! In the course of his remarks he may make a statement which, in the circumstances, may not be as clear as he would have put it in a calmer atmosphere.  If honorable members will look at the  *Hansard*  proof, they will see that very frequently interjections come in, and that there is sometimes an indication that interjections are so numerous that they are not taken down, an intimation that there was disorder, or that several members were interjecting. In those circumstances it would be grossly unfair to the  Speaker,  or to any other honorable member, to have uncorrected  *Hansard*  proofs circulated over the country or put in the hands of other honorable members. Although it is the practice, and it is allowable, for honorable members to have a certain number of copies of revises, it is not the practice to give them uncorrected proofs for the purpose of general circulation, unless they are satisfied that the proofs do not need correction. There is, I understand, only one uncorrected proof in the first instance sent to an honorable member for his correction. He may correct the proof, or he may not, as he pleases, and then, on application, he is entitled to get a certain number of revises. 

##### Mr MCDONALD:

-- I would like to know, sir, who authorized the sending out of the proof which I hold in my hand? This morning a proof was sent to me, and it is simply impossible to say what it means, owing to the peculiar way in which it is pasted together. There was a good deal of interjecting on the opposite side while I was speaking, and the result was that I had to listen, and then to reply, and thus get something in. If I have not an opportunity to see what I was replying to, how can I correct the proof or say whether it is correct or not? This is the first time in the thirteen years' history of this Parliament that this sort of thing has been done. I would like honorable members to see this proof that I hold in my hand. The speech is. chopped off after a couple of lines. Then there is a break, and then follows another couple of lines, which, in their turn, are succeeded by another break. Under the circumstances, it is not possible to do anything with these proofs. During my thirteen years' experience in this Parliament, I have never seen a proof like it. I wish to know upon whose authority this change has been instituted. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">LP</small>

-- I should like to make some reference to this matter. I have received a similar proof. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! Is the Prime Minister about to ask a question ? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- Very well, I shall raise the question later if you will not allow me to do it now. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The Prime Minister will see that if I permit him to intervene when a question has been put to me, every other honorable member may claim a similar right. It is irregular to ask a series of questions in regard to the same matter. I will make inquiries into the question which has been raised., and ascertain what has been done. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- I wish to ask you, sir, if you will be good enough io see that the old practice is reverted to? I confess that my proof was entirely unintelligible, and, moreover, it consisted of a series of slips cut out from somewhere and pasted on a whole sheet. It is impossible, I submit, for an honorable member to intelligently review his own speech in the absence of the matter which has preceded it. I confess I did not think over the matter at the time. I thought that perhaps the position was one peculiar to myself. I do submit that it will impose a disability upon honorable members, and will seriously impair the value of  *Hansard*  as a permanent record, if that practice be persisted in. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Why not regard the matter as one of privilege, and settle it now? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- Is it not better to have the thing settled without submitting a motion in the House? My honorable friends opposite must recollect that all this trouble arises out of their seeing and making use of other people's proofs when they had no right to do so. I ask you, sir, to take action with a view to remedying this matter. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I can only say that it is my desire to meet the wishes of honorable members. I desire to safeguard their rights and privileges, and to protect them from having their uncorrected  *Hansard*  proofs brought up in evidence against them - a course of procedure which is against all the previous practice of the House and of this Parliament. I do not know what has been done in regard to this particular matter, and I can only inquire into it with a view to seeing how far it has proceeded, and direct the attention of the Chief of the  *Hansard*  Staff to it. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- I join with the Prime Minister in his desire that the old system should be reverted to. I join with him and with  **Mr. Speaker**  in affirming that so far as practicable the unre vised  *Hansard*  proofs ought not to be permitted to go beyond the hands of honorable members, so long as they are white proofs, as between the member who spoke and the member who intervened- 

##### Mr Groom:

-- And  **Mr. Speaker**  also. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- And  **Mr. Speaker,**  too. I suggest that as they are only proofs- 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- Honorable membershave no more right to use them than they have to repeat a private conversation. It amounts to the same thing. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- With all due respect to the view which you, sir, have expressed, I suggest that any ruling which you may give, and which intervenes in the speech of an honorable member, should be incorporated in the uncorrected  *Hansard*  proof of that honorable member. It should be recognised by honorable members that  **Mr. Speaker's**  unrevised proofs cannot be used against him any more than a private member's unrevised proofs can be used against him. When once we have reached that sensible point we shall understand each other a great deal better. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I shall certainly have regard to the wishes of honorable members. In the words of  **Mr. Speaker**  Lenthall, " I have neither eyes to see nor ears to hear, save only as the House shall direct." 

##### Mr POYNTON:

-- Did I understand you, sir, to say in regard to alterations made in the form of the distribution of  *Hansard*  proofs, that you did not know who gave the instruction for those alterations ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member did not rightly understand me to say that. I am not aware that honorable members' speeches have been mutilated by the form in which the  *Hansard*  proofs are distributed, and I gave no instructions in regard to that matter. I have already said that I will have a consultation with the Chief of the  *Hansard*  Staff in regard to the whole matter, and will endeavour, as far as possible, to meet the wishes of honorable members. 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- May I be permitted, sir, to direct your attention to a few remarks which I made on Friday last, when, in the course of a seven minutes' speech, you gave seven rulings. I propose to hand the proof to you, and I ask that it should be returned, because it will be an interesting exhibit for a museum. At the same time I desire to know who gave the instructions that this alteration should be made in the method of distributing the  *Hansard*  proofs ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Before I can give a definite reply I must see the proof. If the honorable member will hand it to me. I shall be glad. 


 *Later :* 


##### Mr FISHER:

-- I am sorry to trouble you again,  **Mr. Speaker,**  but there is amongst my honorable friends some misapprehension regarding the reply which you gave in reference to the alteration of the form of distributing  *Hansard*  proofs. Are you in a position to say who gave the order to alter what had been the custom and practice up to the occurrence of a certain incident a few days ago. If you are not in a position to give us the information, will you give the House an opportunity to investigate from where the order came ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- So far as any instructions given by me are concerned, they related only to my own speeches. I have already said that I shall consult the Chief of the  *Hansard*  Staff, and when I have done so I shall be in a position to inform the House of the matter. I shall take the earliest opportunity to consult with him.

#### DEFENCE REGULATIONS

##### Mr KELLY:<br><small class="text-muted">LP</small>

-- The honorable member for Batman recently put a question in respect of the publication of a compendium ©f the Regulations under the Defence Act. The reply is as follows: - 

  >It is considered that such a course is hardly advisable at the present time in view of the fact that during the transition period of the Defence Scheme two sets of regulations have to be kept in force, the one applicable to the voluntarily enlisted men, and the other to those serving under Part XII. of the Act. Under these circumstances, Ihe regulations can hardly be otherwise than bulky, but when it is possible to consolidate the Commonwealth Military and Universal Training Regulations it is considered that much of the difficulty pointed out by  **Mr. Brennan**  will be overcome. 
  >
  >A manual of offences and penalties under the  Act and regulations is, however, being prepared now. While this manual could not be considered to be a compendium of all the regulations, seeing that it only deals with offences and penalties, it is thought that same will contain a good deal of information in a concise form which should be useful.

#### MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE

##### Mr ARCHIBALD:<br><small class="text-muted">HINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I desire to ask the Prime Minister -whether it is the intention of the Government to restore the right of this House to challenge the life of the Government by the old constitutional method of a no-confidence motion? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">LP</small>

-- All that I have to say is that that right has never been taken away from this House, and that it seems to me- to be exercised every hour of every day that we are here. 


 *Later:* 


##### Mr ARCHIBALD:

-- I wish to ask the Attorney-General a question concerning at matter of constitutional law. Will he say whether there is any precedent in the British Empire for the action of the Government in preventing a no-confidence debate being continued to a finish? 

##### Mr W H IRVINE:<br><small class="text-muted">FLINDERS, VICTORIA &middot; ANTI-SOC; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917</small>

-- I feel sure that the honorable member, with his long parliamentary experience, must know that a question of this kind can only be addressed properly to the head of the Government. 

##### Mr ARCHIBALD:

-- I wish to put to the Prime Minister a question that I put to the Attorney-General. Is there any precedent in the British Empire for the action of the Government in preventing a no-confidence debate- 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member has already asked that ques tion, or a question of the same character, two or three times. 

##### Mr Poynton:

-- The Attorney-General told the honorable member to direct his question to the head of the Government. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Then I beg the honorable member's pardon. I did not know that the Attorney-General had done so. 

##### Mr ARCHIBALD:

-- The question I desire to put to the Prime Minister is whether there is any precedent in the British Empire for the action of the Government in preventing a no-confidence debate being continued to a finish? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">LP</small>

-- As my honorable friends opposite are constantly claiming credit for making precedents, I should think that they would therefore appreciate our action on this occasion fi we have made one. 

##### Mr Archibald:

-- It shows what a fraud you are. 

##### Mr WEBSTER:

-- I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question without notice-- 

##### Mr JOSEPH Cook:

-- Will the honorable member allow me to interrupt him on a point of order? This kind of thing is beginning again to-day. I made a reply to the question put by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, and he immediately called out, " It shows what a fraud you are." I require those words to be withdrawn. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The Prime Minister desires that an expression used by the honorable member for Hindmarsh shall be withdrawn, and I ask that the honorable member withdraw it. 

##### Mr Archibald:

-- I withdraw the words,  **Mr. Speaker.**

#### RAILWAY GAUGES OF AUSTRALIA

##### Mr ORCHARD:<br><small class="text-muted">NEPEAN, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the Prime Minister yet received the report of the Committee appointed to inquire into the railway gauges of Australia, and, if so, will he state what steps are being taken by the Government to invite consideration of the Committee's recommendations by the various States? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">LP</small>

-- I shall be glad if the honorable member will give notice of his question. I may say that the recommendations of the Committee are available, and are of the most valuable character. They appear to bring the question within the region of practical politics. I am only awaiting a favorable opportunity to thoroughly investigate the whole matter, with a view, I hope, to future parliamentary action.

#### TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES: INQUIRIES ABROAD

##### Mr FINLAYSON:<br><small class="text-muted">BRISBANE, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- There is in this morning's newspapers a report to the effect that two postal officials have been appointed, with authority to proceed to Great Britain and the United States of America, to make a special investigation into telegraphic and telephonic matters. It is only a few years since  **Mr. Hesketh**  made very exhaustive inquiries in the same direction. I desire to ask the PostmasterGeneral whether  **Mr. Hesketh's**  inquiries and recommendations have been found useless, and what special qualifications the two officers have for the appointment they have received? 

##### Mr AGAR WYNNE:<br><small class="text-muted">LP</small>

-- The improvements in telephonic matters, in the United States of America more particularly, are so rapid that it is necessary for us to keep pace with them. The information obtained by  **Mr. Hesketh**  was of great value, and advantage has been taken of it. The gentlemen who are to make these inquiries are two of the most competent young officers in the Department.
