#### DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT

Grant of Supply

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">WIDE BAY, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- I ask the Prime Minister whether he has any communication to make to the House, or whether he intends to pursue a course which will enable us to look upon his smiling face a little longer! 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Home Affairs &middot; PARRAMATTA, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP</small>

-- A day or two ago I tendered certain advice to His Excellency the Governor-General, which he has been pleased to accept, and I have to announce to the House that His Excellency has decided to dissolve simultaneously both Houses of the Parliament so soon as the ordinary provision has been made for the conduct of the Public Service during the time of the elections. Following the usual . practice, I therefore move- 

That the House do now adjourn.
