### ANNIVERSARY OF THE DECLARATION OF WAR

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Treasurer &middot; Wide Bay &middot; ALP</small>

By leave, I move - 

That we, the Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament
            assembled, do, on the expiration of a year of war, present to His Majesty our most loyal
            service, and record our unchanging determination to continue to a victorious end
            the struggle for the maintenance of the ideals of Liberty and Justice which are
            the common and sacred cause of the Allied Nations. 

This is a fitting occasion for the renewal by this Parliament, representing as it does
          the Commonwealth of Australia, of our pledge of loyalty to His Majesty, and for a
          declaration to all our brothers of the British race and to the nations with which we are
          allied, of our undaunted determination to see the war through to a successful end. 

When the war broke out many thought that the year would see its close; to-day no one
          would predict when it will finish. It is enough to say that a successful end will be our
          aim and object. We are determined to make every sacrifice necessary to achieve it. 

The war has involved eleven nations. Fighting has taken place on three continents -
          America and Australia alone have been spared the spilling of blood. But, though Australian
          territory has remained unviolated, Australia's sons are acting their part at the seat
          of war. Our justification for the part that we are playing in the conflict is that our
          interests, equally with those of the Mother Country, are involved. And Australia has no
          cause to feel other than flattered at the way in which her sons have responded to the call
          of arms - 75,000 of the best and bravest have gone to the front overseas. More than 40,000
          are undergoing training here in preparation for despatch. Those of them who have been
          privileged to meet the foe face to face have well upheld the honour of their country.
          Indeed, they have added lustre to her name, and have gained imperishable renown for
          themselves. But all has not yet been done that must be done. No one can foresee the
          necessities of even the hour, and we know not what the future will demand, but whatever
          the sacrifices that we may have to make, let them be made cheerfully. Far better that we
          should die than be under the servitude of the nation which is our enemy. 

A singular series of incidents marked the commencement of the war. Servia found
          herself in difficulties with Austria, and Russia took her part. Germany thereupon declared
          war against Russia. But she did not immediately commence to make war upon that country.
          Her first step was to invade - not Russia; not even Servia; but Luxembourg, a neutral
          state. She then demanded of France what that country proposed to do, and when France
          replied that it was her intention to protect her own interests, Germany declared war
          against France. Yet the first blow fell - not upon France, but upon Belgium, with whom
          Germany had no quarrel. In neither case did Germany attack in the first instance the
          nation against which she had declared war. Having declared war on Russia, she fell upon
          Luxembourg. Having declared war upon France, she fell upon Belgium. That fact in itself
          condemns that nation in the eyes of every free and freedom-loving people in the world.
          Whatever the military power and prestige of the Germans, it is the duty of the rest of
          mankind to put the German nation into its proper place. 

I believe that Australians will do in this war more than the most optimistic of us
          could, before war began, have believed possible. I believe, too, that our patriotism will
          rise to the measure of our requirements. It becomes us all, whatever may be our position,
          our wealth, or our ability of personal service, to do what we can to maintain our just
          cause. To repeat what I said at the very beginning, Australia in this business must be
          with the Mother Country and for her, to our last man and to our last shilling. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">Parramatta</small>

It was only on my return to Melbourne to-day that I learned of the intention of
            the Prime Minister to submit this motion, and I did so with unalloyed satisfaction. It
            is meet that on this anniversary of the declaration of war we should express our
            unchanged and unchanging determination to see the thing through. That seems to me to be
            the keynote of the right honorable gentleman's motion and of his speech. There is
            only one thing for us to do, and that is to continue to strive to the uttermost, with all
            our will and all our strength, until the war is over, to win the victory for the cause
            of justice and humanity. Ours is not the  *role*  of
            merely an outside interested spectator. We are in this war through and through. It is
            our war as much as it is the war of the Allies - as much as it is the war of the Empire
            at large. 

After a tragic year of fighting and struggling, the causes still remain, and so
          many of our best have been laid low that we owe it to them to continue the work they have
          carried on so successfully, adding fresh laurels to our national fame, and covering
          themselves with an imperishable glory. Belgium still remains under the heel of the
          oppressor. That was one of the reasons why we sprang to arms. It is worth while remembering
          that in the hour of her trial Belgium appealed, not to her next door neighbour, but
          to us who are far away. Her appeal was to the British Empire, for protection, for
          preservation, for security. Belgium still exists - a fugitive nation, a suffering nation,
          a bleeding nation, a nation bereft of home, bereft almost of government, bereft of all
          those things that make for our national pride and honour. While ever Belgium is in that
          position we must not relax a single effort. We must see her through. We must avenge her
          fully and completely for all that she has suffered in the interests of humanity. Then,
          that swaggering, blustering, theatrical monarch is still astride a section of Europe,
          boasting of his destructive sword and all that it is to accomplish. I hope we shall see
          the proper sequel to that boasting soon. I imagine that when our great armies get moving
          thoroughly, when our grand reserve has been properly mobilized, that we may break the
          blade of that sword, or, at any rate, make it of non-effect. 

These are causes for which we are still fighting, and for which we must continue to
          fight. There are other considerations, too, which come home to us at this moment. Our own
          Empire is threatened. Our own old home - that home we all hail from, and are so proud of -
          that home which is the centre of all our parliamentary institutions and of nearly
          everything that we revere. That fact alone must surely make an appeal to us as
          parliamentarians. Many other thoughts come to mind as one considers that old home, with
          its freedom, its pieties, its associations, its history, its literature. If there be one
          thing more than another for which the British Empire has always stood, it is for its love
          of liberty and of law; and it is that love of liberty that has been one of our most
          inspiring motives in this mighty war. Our own Australia is at stake, too, with all its
          freedom, its sunshine, its prospects, and all that it connotes for a wider, wiser, and
          more humane civilization than this world has yet seen. 

It is for the future that we fight, as well as for the maintenance of the traditions
          of the past. I hope nothing will interfere to make for an inconclusive peace. To stop the
          war at present by any means whatever would be the greatest tragedy which could
          happen to civilization. We cannot have a repetition of this struggle. We must finish it
          while we are at it, no matter what its cost may be, and, therefore, I welcome the
          expression - I put all the heart and soul of my being into that expression - "
          unchanging determination." It does not need many words to commend a motion of this
          kind. We are all of one heart and purpose in the prosecution of the war to a successful
          conclusion, and on this anniversary of its outbreak we are more determined than ever to
          maintain those ideals for which our Empire stands, and for which we are associated with
          our Allies. Onward lies peace and progress and prosperity and national honour. To hesitate
          at this time would be to earn the contempt of the generations that are to come for having
          toyed with our glorious heritage and risked their destiny. That, I trust, shall never be
          said of us; and, therefore, I second this motion with the greatest possible heartiness, and I hope
        we shall carry it unanimously, and with acclamation. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Ordered -

That the foregoing resolution be forwarded through His Excellency the
          Governor-General.

#### REFERENDA PROPOSALS

##### Mr BRUCE SMITH:<br><small class="text-muted">PARKES, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; FT; ANTI-SOC from 1906; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917</small>

-- After the very eloquent and fervent forecast of the difficulties of the Empire
              and of Australia to which we have listened, I should like to know whether the
              Government intend to plunge this country into a constitutional struggle during the
              next three months? 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- May I say, in answer to the honorable member for Parkes, that this Government
              will not plunge this country into any dispute of any kind, unless people are
              unpatriotic enough to make it do so?

### EXPORTS

##### Mr TUDOR:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; YARRA, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- The honorable member for Melbourne, on the 30th June, asked me to prepare a return
            showing the exports of a number of items from Australia from August, 1914, to June,
            1915. I have had the return prepared, but I would point out to the honorable member that
            a return covering any series of months is, as a rule, inconclusive unless it can be
            compared with similar months for previous years. I would also point out that included in
            these exports are the foodstuffs required for provisioning the transports which have
            recently left our shores.

#### EXPEDITIONARY FORCES

Payments to Soldiers in Hospital: Motor Ambulances and Travelling Kitchens: Delay in
          Reaching the Front. * 

##### Mr CHARLTON:<br><small class="text-muted">HUNTER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Is the Minister for* the Navy aware that a statement is in circulation to the
              effect that the pay of wounded soldiers, on their going into hospital, is reduced to
              ls. per day, and that, in consequence, money has to be remitted by relatives for their
              support. Will the Minister say whether the statement is founded on fact? 

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for the Navy &middot; BASS, TASMANIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- Any soldier who has to go into hospital to receive medical treatment on account
              of wounds received at the front remains under whole pay conditions, and receives his
              pay, without any deductions, until he is discharged. If such a statement as that
              referred to by the honorable member for Hunter is in circulation it is utterly without
              foundation. 

##### Mr THOMAS:<br><small class="text-muted">BARRIER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I understand that a private, on leaving for the front, is entitled to draw only
              ls. per day of his allowance, and that the balance is retained for him, or distributed
              by the Department as desired by him. For at least some little time after going into
              hospital wounded soldiers were prevented by either an Imperial or a Commonwealth
              regulation from drawing that sum of ls. per day. I wish to ask the Minister for the
              Navy whether the men in hospital are now receiving it? 

##### Mr JENSEN:

-- A private is entitled to 6s. per day, of which 5s? per day is payable to him
                either weekly, fortnightly, or monthly, and may be allotted as desired by him. He
                may elect to draw only 2s. per day for himself, and to request the Department to pay
                the balance of 3s. per day to his mother, his wife, or some other relative. The
                remaining ls. per day is deferred pay, and is not payable to him until his
                discharge. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- Is the Minister for the Navy able to tell us why the motor ambulances and
              travelling kitchens, the cost of which was subscribed by generous citizens at the end
              of last year, have not yet reached the front, and what is the cause of this
              unconscionable delay? 

##### Mr JENSEN:

-- I shall endeavour to obtain the information, and advise the right honorable
                member.

              contains confidential reports, it is impossible to lay it on the table. It is in the

### RECRUITING : SPEECHES AGAINST ENLISTMENT

##### Sir WILLIAM IRVINE:<br><small class="text-muted">FLINDERS, VICTORIA</small>

-- Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the fact that in Melbourne,
            Sydney, and other parts of the Commonwealth persons are permitted, week after week, to
            address large meetings of their fellow citizens urging them not to enlist, or to take
            part in the war, and pointing out that the war is an unjust one. For obvious reasons, I
            do not wish to be more specific. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- I think the honorable member ought to be. 

##### Sir WILLIAM IRVINE:

-- I do not wish to name either the persons or associations concerned. I ask the
              broad question whether the Prime Minister is aware that persons are doing this, and
              doing so with some mischievous effect, and whether he does not think , it possible to
              take some steps at this crisis to prevent the continuance of such treasonable
              practices. 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- But for one or two references in the press, and a statement or two in Parliament,
            I am quite unconscious of any serious feeling in the direction suggested by the
            honorable member. 

##### Mr Richard Foster:

-- It is going on. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- Subject to the exceptions I have mentioned, I am not cognisant of any serious
              feeling of the kind stated. I am sure that those who are talking in the way mentioned
              by the honorable member are but a negligible fraction of the community. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">DAMPIER, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- In view of the answer just given by the Prime Minister to the question addressed
            to him by the honorable member for Flinders, I wish to ask him whether a resolution
            passed by the Clerks Union, and published in the  *Argus*  of 24th ultimo, which is supposed to have been sent to him, has yet
            reached him. The resolution is as follows: - 

  >Further, the union wishes to impress upon the Federal Ministry and the Federal
            Labour party- 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member is now going beyond the asking of a question. 

##### Mr GREGORY:

-- Then, sir, I shall ask the Prime Minister whether he nas received a copy of the
              resolution in question, in which statements were made that would undoubtedly restrict
              enlistment, and whether he intends in the future- to. insist that such people shall
              receive preference of employment in the Public Service? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- I cannot say whether or not the resolution has been received by my Department. I
              do not know what were the terms of the resolution, or whether any treasonable
              statement was made in it. I do not understand the interest displayed in this matter. I
              can only say that I could, if necessary, point to a few men on both sides of politics
              who are insane on the subject. 

##### Sir WILLIAM IRVINE:

-- Is the Prime Minister prepared to have inquiries made into the truth of the
              general allegations I have made, and if he finds that there is truth in them, Will he,
              as Leader of the Government, be prepared_ to announce publicly in clear and emphatic
              terms that the conduct of any person or any body of persons on any side in politics
              who urges others not to enlist is a form of treasonable practice that is punishable
              under the laws of the country? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- As Leader of the Government and the Chief Executive Officer of the Commonwealth
              I decline to declare to the people that unless they obey the law they will be
              punished. That fact is known to every citizen, and a mere threat would be worthless.
              If the honorable member for Flinders will supply information which will enable the
              Government to charge any person or persons with a violation of the law affecting
              recruiting, or anything else, the Govern-, ment will take action. 

##### Sir William Irvine:

-- Will the right honorable gentleman have an inquiry made? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- Yes.

#### AUSTRALIAN WAR LOAN

##### Mr HIGGS:<br><small class="text-muted">CAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Has the Treasurer seen a statement published in the Melbourne  *Herald*  of Monday last, which may possibly have the
              effect of deterring people from investing in the present issue of the Australian War
              Loan? The statement in question was to the effect that the right honorable gentleman
              had been asked whether there was a probability of those now investing in the loan
              being given, later on "a more equitable advance " - a higher rate of interest,
              I presume - and that the Prime Minister's answer was non-committal. Had the
                 *Herald*  any ground for making such a statement,
              and does not the right honorable gentleman think that it is calculated to have a
              prejudicial effect upon the success of the Australian War Loan? If he has not yet made
              a statement on the subject, will he now state emphatically his view as to whether
              those now investing in the present issue will be likely to secure, later on, a higher
              rate of interest? I hand the Prime Minister a copy of the statement in question.
            

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I had not seen before the statement which the honorable member has just handed
              to me. I find that it was published in the " Markets and' Money " column,
              a column that deals more with markets than with money. Those investors who are waiting
              for a higher rate of interest, on the second instalment of the loan, will be
              disappointed. So far as the Government are concerned, that point has been settled
              definitely and distinctly, and our decision has been conveyed frequently to the public
              and the people concerned. It is a mischievous thing for any writer, claiming to have
              financial knowledge, to say that my statement was non-committal. My statement was
              direct, and my only doubt is as to whether the interest to be paid is not too high.

              what action the Commonwealth Government contemplate taking to prevent the existing
              functions of the Commonwealth being exercised by the States? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- It does not come within the province of a State Government to prohibit the
              export of any commodity unless the State has previously acquired that commodity. As to
              Commonwealth action, until some person who is aggrieved makes complaint the
              Commonwealth Government cannot act. Under the Wheat Acquisition Act of New South
              Wales, the same position arose. The Commonwealth Government were waited upon by a
              deputation of persons who had been prevented from sending wheat across the border. We
              asked those citizens to make a definite and detailed statement of their position. They
              did so, and upon that statement we took action. We shall take what action we can in
              regard  *to*  export - and I confess that the remedy
              does not appear very clear on the face of it - when any citizens claim that they have
              been refused permission to trade freely throughout Australia.

                in Lithgow; and I ask him when- the matter may be expected to be decided, and
                whether it will be decided by this House? 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- This is really a matter which comes within the purview of the Minister of Home
              Affairs. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- It is a matter of policy. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- The question contains a statement which I do not accept as a fact. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- What is that? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- I refer to the statement as to the transfer of the Factory from Lithgow.
              

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- No, no; I asked whether you were aware of the unsettling effect of the present
                arrangement in Lithgow, and whether you proposed to carry out the recommendation of
                the Public Works Committee? I further asked whether the recommendation would first
                be submitted to the House? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- In the first place, the removal of the Factory from Lithgow is not involved;
                it is a matter of duplicating the Factory, and I understand that the facilities in
                our own Federal Territory are greater than elsewhere for the erection of a new
                Factory, with the object of doubling the output. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- Will you forgive me? Is it in contemplation to keep two rifle Factories going
                at the same time? Come now ! 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- That will be a question of utility, and it is one for debate. I have only to
                say that the Government will not do anything that they cannot maintain in this
                House. The question of the site will be submitted to this House and Parliament.
              

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- Soon ? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- Yes; you will have plenty of opportunity for discussion.

#### JAPAN AND CHINA

##### Mr J H CATTS:<br><small class="text-muted">COOK, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Is the Minister of External Affairs aware that, in January, Japan issued an
              ultimatum to China, and that, as the result of the negotiations, there has been a
              compulsory military unification of Japan and China, practically under the dictatorship
              of Japan, and that thereby the balance of power in the Pacific has been radically
              altered ? It is stated iu the press that the British Government were consulted; and I
              should like to know whether the Minister of External Affairs has been in any way

#### RED CROSS FUNDS

##### Mr BRUCE SMITH:<br><small class="text-muted">PARKES, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; FT; ANTI-SOC from 1906; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917</small>

-- The Prime Minister has invited members to mention specific instances in which
              money belonging to the Red Cross Society has been used to buy military necessaries at
              Liverpool. I ask, therefore, whether the right honorable gentleman is aware that
              Professor  **Sir Thomas**  Anderson Stuart has given
              evidence before  **Mr. Justice**  Rich that he found
              that camp necessaries had been applied for to the Red Cross Society, and supplied out
              of the Society's funds, and is he aware that the professor said, further, that had
              he known the Government would be relieved of. its duty in regard to the supply of
              these articles he would have hesitated about contributing to the Red Cross funds. If
              the Prime Minister is not aware of these statements will he look into the matter?
            

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I have not seen the statements referred to. The matter is one for further
              inquiry. I understand the honorable member to say that Professor  **Sir Thomas**  Anderson Stuart has stated that the Defence
              Department seized some Red Cross goods. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- No; that it applied for and received from the Red Cross Society camp
                necessaries which the Government should have supplied. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- By way of loan? 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- No, it is alleged that the people in camp had to go cadging to the Red Cross
                Society for things with which the Government should have provided them. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- I am not acquainted with the facts. I regret to hear the Leader of the
                Opposition suggest that some shortage has occurred through maladministration. My
                view is that anything that has been taken from the Red Cross Society should be
                returned, and I shall see that that is done. 

##### Mr PAGE:

-- Will the Prime Minister refer the honorable member for Parkes to a letter which
              appeared in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning
                Herald,</inline> in which  **Mr. Ash**  ton, M.L.C.,
              justifies what was done? 

##### Mr BRUCE SMITH:<br><small class="text-muted">PARKES, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; FT; ANTI-SOC from 1906; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917</small>

-- He did not justify it. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- All I can say is that I deeply regret that charity should be concerned with
                the supplying of camp necessaries. I understand that the evidence of Professor
                Stuart was given before a Royal Commissioner, who has not yet furnished his report.
                If that is so it was most unseemly to bring the matter before this House.

#### EXPORT OF WHEAT

Chartering Agreement

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- Last week the Prime Minister said that the wheat charter agreement was made as a
              matter of urgency, and the Attorney-General promised that we should be furnished with
              a copy of it. The AttorneyGeneral has since stated that we may have a copy of the
              agreement next week. In view of the fact that a harvest of approximately 120,000,000
              bushels of wheat is affected by the arrangement, I ask whether the agreement has yet
              been reduced to writing and its terms finalised? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- There is no agreement in the sense in which the honorable member spoke of the
              matter. An arrangement has been come to under which the Commonwealth, acting for the
            

States, is the sole agent for securing freight for the export of wheat
            and other produce from Australia during the coming season. We have engaged the two firms
            whose names have been mentioned to act for us in this matter. I hope soon to lay on the
            table of the House the understanding that has been arrived at. As soon as the firms have
            supplied me with the necessary information it will be made available to honorable
            members. I hope that that will be to-morrow. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- Have these firms the exclusive right of chartering for the export of the
                coming harvest? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- It is the Commonwealth, and not our agents, that has the right of exclusive
                charter. The firms mentioned have no right to charter a single vessel without the
                approval of the Government, and the arrangements made with other shipping firms are
                such as to disturb them as little as possible, if ali all. 

##### Mr J H CATTS:

-- Will the AttorneyGeneral see that sufficient wheat is retained in Australia for
              the consumption of our people, so that we shall not have the farce played of sending
              Australian produce to the ' other end of the world and bringing it back again to
              meet our requirements? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- That is a matter exclusively for the States. Our only power is that over
                exports. So far as I know there is not the slightest danger of more than the surplus
                produce being exported. The arrangements are being made with a view to the
                exportation of the produce that is not required for the people of Australia. 

##### Mr GLYNN:<br><small class="text-muted">ANGAS, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Does the agreement provide, or does the Attorney-General intend to provide, that
              no one except those named by the Government will be permitted to charter ships? In
              other words, is the Government going to direct what ships may carry away wheat from
              Australia ? I ask, too, whether any provision has been made regarding the percentage
              which, under ordinary circumstances, is allowed by shippers to the producers of wheat.
              I understand that the custom has been to give a rebate to the farmers which increases
              their price. Has the agreement which has been entered into secured this 4 or 5 per
              cent, to the farmers? Is there a specific provision regarding the commission that has
              to be paid to the two shipping companies, and if so, does it prevent the payment of a
              commission, the benefit of which, hitherto, by agreement between the shippers and the
              farmers, has been given to the farmers ? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I understand that the customary arrangement is for the charterer to receive lj
                per cent, and the shipper 3J per cent. This arrangement will not be disturbed. As to
                ohe chartering of ships by persons other than the firms named, the object of the
                arrangement is to secure the co-operation of every agency that will bring freight to
                Australia, and all we insist on is that arrangements for freight should go through
                the channel that we have provided. A larg-3 amount of freight, . perhaps the greater
                amount, is furnished by the regular liners, tramps, and the Government transports.
                Our arrangement is to provide supplementary freight, which would not come here under
                normal circumstances. I have asked the representatives of the shippers of wheat to
                meet me on Friday to discuss some of the matters to which the honorable member has
                referred. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA</small>

-- Has the Commonwealth Government given to Gibbs, Bright and Co. and Elder, Smith
              and Co. the exclusive right to secure space or to charter vessels on behalf of the
              Commonwealth, or is the Government free to engage other agencies if necessary ?
            

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I have, already answered that question, but perhaps I had better make the
                situation quite clear. The present position is that, with a fluctuating wheat
                market, with wheat values possibly falling, we have a stiffening freight market. It
                is very obvious that if there are twenty or thirty operators on that market, higher
                freight values may result, and higher freight values may spell ruin to the farmers
                of Australia. For this reason we have arranged that there shall be only one operator
                acting on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia. That is the position. Every man
                would do the same in his own business.

### WAR PENSIONS BILL (No. 2)

{:#subdebate-39-0}
#### Third Reading

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for the Navy &middot; Bass &middot; ALP</small>

-- I move - 

That this Bill be now read a third time. I desire to say that, in compliance with
            the promise I made to the Committee last week respecting two amendments then suggested,
            that the points raised have been looked into by the Attorney-General, and the Government
            are now willing to have the suggested amendments incorporated in the Bill when it is
            dealt with in another place. One provides for the further definition of what a dependant
            is. Under it, the term dependant means the wife or widow and children of a soldier, and
            such other members of his family as were wholly or in part dependent on his earnings at
            any time during the period of twelve months prior to his enlistment. We propose also to
            make the further provision that a child who, on attaining the age of sixteen years, is,
            in the opinion of the Commissioner, unable to earn a livelihood, may then be granted a
            further pension as' a dependant, during the remainder of his or her life. That is,
            of course, provided the child was dependent at the time her father was killed or totally
            incapacitated. 

##### Mr GROOM:<br><small class="text-muted">Darling Downs</small>

-- I hope the Minister will permit me to draw his attention to the fact that the
              honorable member for Richmond raised the question of the amount which had been
              contributed to the support of the dependant by a soldier prior to his death or
              permanent incapacity. The honorable member's point was that, in the event of a
              person contributing to the support of a dependant for a period of twelve months prior
              to his death or permanent incapacity, a certain definite sum, if that sum did not
              exceed the amount stated in the schedule, the Commissioner should take the sum as
              evidence of the extent to which the person was dependent, and make the pension at
              least that amount. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- That point will be considered in this proposed amendment. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- The Bill is going to the Senate now, and will come back for further
                consideration, when we shall have to consider the amendments made by the Senate ;
                but the reason I mention the matter briefly now is that it may save discussion in
                another place. I do not think any time will be lost by having the position stated
                clearly. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- If the honorable member reads the proposed amendments, he will see that they
                embrace what he has in mind. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- I do not .think they do. It seems to me that the amendments only deal with the
                definition of what is a dependant, and not with the point raised by the honorable
                member for Richmond, which was, I think, originally mentioned by the honorable
                member for Parramatta. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- I informed the honorable member for Richmond that I could not give any promise
                regarding the whole 06 his amendment, but I think the amendments to be made embrace
                a good deal of what he had in mind. A dependant will now be able to explain to the
                Commissioner what he or she received from the deceased or incapacitated soldier.
              

##### Mr GROOM:

-- According to the present law, that evidence can be given. The trouble is that
                the Commissioner is notbound to award the amount contributed.. A dependant' may
                say, "I was in receipt of £1 a week," and the Commissionermay award
                10s. That is the trouble. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Looking at the administration as it is, has the honorable memberany doubt on
                that point? 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- I may have no doubt,but a case was mentioned by the honoLiable member for
                Parramatta ,in which that, was actually done. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- When? 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- It was stated during; the debate. The honorable member quoted* the case of a
                widow who received much* less than the sum she stated she received) from her son. I
                quite agree that it seemsextraordinary that any Commissioner should set aside
                specific evidence on Such a point. The amendment foreshadowed! by the Minister seems
                to cover the point, raised by the honorable member for Gippsland that a dependant
                means the wife or widow and children of a soldier. The idea, was that a wife and
                child shall be regarded as dependants without being called upon to give proof of the
                fact. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- Yes. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- As I understand it, the position will be this, if the amendment is accepted :
                A widow and a child, no mat-. ter how much their income from private sources may be,
                will be absolutely entitled to pensions, according to schedule rates,, without their
                other income being taken into consideration. 

##### Mr Wise:

-- At full rates! 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- Yes. That is the intention of this amendment, and the Minister indicates that
                I am stating the position clearly. I think it is what the House, desires * 

##### Mr WISE:<br><small class="text-muted">Gippsland</small>

.- Whenthe Bill was being discussed in Committee the other night, the desire was
              that a widow or child should be entitled to theension as a right and not as a
              dependant, have not seen the proposed amendment, but it seemed to me while the
              Minister was reading it that it would -again group up "wives and children"
              with " dependants." The difficulty could be overcome by an amendment of
              section 3 of the principal Act, which is the operative provision so far as the payment
              of pensions is concerned. It declares that the Commonwealth " shall, subject to
              this Act, be liable to pay to the member or his dependants or both " a pension. If
              we substituted for those words the words *' shall be liable to pay to the member,
              his wife, child, or his dependants " our intention would be made clear. The desire
              expressed by the Committee when the Bill was before us last week was that the widow
              and children of deceased soldiers should receive their pensions as of right, and that
              it should not be necessary for them to prove that they were wholly or in part
              dependent upon the deceased. If the Bill be amended to carry out that intention, we
              shall be satisfied. 

##### Mr THOMAS:<br><small class="text-muted">Barrier</small>

-- I am very glad that the Government propose in another place so to amend the
              Bill as to make it clear that the widow and children of a deceased soldier shall be
              entitled to the full pension payable in respect of a man of his rank. The amendment,
              however, while excellent as far as it goes, does not go far enough. 

##### Mr Fenton:

-- What about the widowed mother ? 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- That was the point to which I was about to refer. It seems reasonable that the
                first call should be made upon unmarried rather than upon -married men with
                families, and there can he no doubt that the majority who have gone so far are young
                unmarried men. That being so, the Bill, as proposed to be amended in this respect,
                will not apply to the majority of our men at the front.. T recognise that there are
                difficulties iu the way of achieving the object I have in view; but unless we place
                widowed mothers in the same position as the widows and children of deceased
                soldiers, we shall have not merely anomalies, but very serious hardships. The
                honorable member for Fawkner cited a case which was very much to the point. He told
                us of a young fellow who was practically the mainstay of his mother, and who desired
                   *to*  go to the front. His mother was not very
                anxious that he should go, but he pressed her for permission to enlist, saying,
                " Never mind, mother; if I go, and am killed, you will be provided for; you will
                receive a pension of .£52 a year. ' ' He went, and was killed, but
                because his widowed mother was not wholly dependent upon him, since she had two
                daughters who were able to contribute to her support, she was deprived of the
                pension. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- Under the Bill as proposed to be amended, if that mother can show that she was
                dependent to some extent upon the young man prior to his enlistment, she will
                receive a pension. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- The full pension- the £52 per year? 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- She will receive by way of pension the amount to which she is entitled.
              

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- That is quite another matter. That means that she will not receive £1 a
                week, although the widow of such a man would do so. The honorable member for
                Richmond last week told us of the mother of a young man killed at the front who had
                been awarded a pension of only £26 per year, because she was drawing £26
                per annum from another source. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- The Commissioner will have extensive powers under the Act. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- He will; but the regulations must be drafted in accordance with the Act, and
                it would be unfair for this House to find fault with the administration later on if
                it allowed the Bill to be framed in such a way that regulations under it contained
                provisions to which they objected. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- Would the honorable member wish the Government to give a pension to a person
                who was not really in need of one? 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- I. have taken up the stand that payment of the full pension, according to the
                rank of the man, .should be absolutely assured - that it should be regarded as part
                and parcel of the conditions of enlistment. The full pension should be payable as of
                right just as is the maternity allowance. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- No country could do that. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- Then it is unfair to accept the services of those who are willing to
                volunteer, and not to make adequate provision for those whom they leave behind. If
                conscription were in force the position would be different. But we are appealing to
                men to volunteer, and the vast majority of those who remain at home have quite as
                much at stake as those who go. 

##### Mr Hampson:

-- "What country is doing as much for its men as Australia is doing ! 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- Why should we not do what is right, irrespective of what other countries may
                he doing? If China elects to pay its men only a few pence per day, is that any
                reason why we should do the same? 

##### Mr Hampson:

-- I had in mind, not. China, but Great -Britain and Canada. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- Our soldiers are receiving better pay than any others at the front, and we
                have in force the best of all war pension measures. Do not cripple the Government
                altogether. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- I do not wish to cripple the Government. The Minister asked a few moments ago
                whether I desired that these pensions should be payable to persons whether they were
                in need of them or not. I would remind him that the amendment proposed to be made in
                another place will give the widow of a deceased soldier the right to a pension
                whether she requires it or not. Why should not a widowed mother be placed in the
                same position? Why should a soldier's widow who is receiving £5,000 a year
                be able to draw the full pension, while the mother of a deceased soldier who has an
                income of only £26 a year is to be allowed to draw only half the pension? I am
                not blaming the Government for the amendment they propose to make ; my only
                complaint is that it does not go far enough. The Government are undoubtedly right in
                applying this principle to the widows and children of deceased soldiers, but they
                should extend it to the widowed mothers of deceased soldiers. I know of a young
                fellow who is under age, and who is extremely anxious to enlist. His widowed mother
                is not at present dependent upon him. 'She is sacrificing herself in order to
                enable him to go to the University, in the hope that he will qualify for a
                profession, and will ultimately be in a position to maintain her. But if he goes to
                the front, and is killed, his widowed mother will receive nothing, since she will
                not be able to show that she was dependent upon him at the time of his enlistment.
              

##### Mr Jensen:

-- If the widowed mother of a deceased soldier can show that she was dependent
                upon him, she will receive the pension, or if she can show that she was partially
                dependent upon him she will receive a proportionate allowance. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- But why should the widow of a soldier be entitled to draw the full pension?
              

##### Mr Jensen:

-- Because she was entirely dependent upon her husband. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- Kb such condition is imposed by the proposed amendment 

##### Mr Tudor:

-- If the mother becomes dependent within five years, she will be entitled to a
                pension. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- Quite so; but if she is in receipt of £26 per annum, she cannot receive,
                by way of pension, more than a further £26. Then, again, if a soldier returns
                from the front incapacitated, is he to draw the full pension, irrespective of any
                income to which he may be entitled? The honorable member for Wimmera has handed to
                me a regulation under the principal Act, which suggests that those whocome back
                incapacitated do not necessarily receive the full pension. They have to answer a
                question as to whether they are entitled to any other pension or superannuation
                allowance. Why is such a question asked? 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- It is understood that if a soldier is incapacitated he has a right to a
                pension. 

##### Mr Sampson:

-- He has to prove that he is incapacitated. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- That is so. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- I think that is right. If a soldier is wounded, but by the time of his return
                to Australia is well and strong again, there is an end to the matter; but if he is
                permanently incapacitated, is he entitled as of right to the pension, or has he to
                give an account of his possessions ? 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- I do not think he has togiv'e an account of what he has. He isentitled to
                the pension as a right. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- Then why should the regulations cast any doubt on the subject? 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- This is a matter to be dealt with by the regulations. 

##### Mr Groom:

-- And they cannot be more expansive than the Act. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- No. They must be based on the Act itself. 

##### Mr Sampson:

-- Sometimes regulations, do not correctly interpret the Act under which they are
                made. 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- Owing to a misapprehension, a regulation that was not really in accordance
                with the Act might be drafted and put in force. It would be manifestly unfair to
                find fault with the administration of the Act because of any question put to a
                soldier or his dependants under regulations that were in conformity with the Act as
                passed by us, but which did not embody what was the actual intention of the
                Legislature. We should have a definite assurance from the Minister- one way or the
                other. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- So far as I know from the Attorney-General, any incapacitated soldier can draw
                a pension as a right.' 

##### Mr THOMAS:

-- If we have an assurance from the Minister that no question will be asked as to
                the soldier's ability to maintain himself, and that all he will Joe required to
                prove will be his incapacitation, I shall be satisfied. Whilst I am pleased that
                widows and fatherless "children are to receive their pensions as a matter of
                right, I am sorry that the Minister .does not propose to accord the widowed mother
                the same treatment. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wimmera</small>

.- I welcome an amendment to meet some of the cases mentioned hy honorable members
              when this Bill was before the House last week-; but, like the honorable member for
              Barrier, I regret that the Minister has not seen fit to extend the scope of the
              amendment, in order to include also the widowed mother. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- Under the existing provisions of the Act the widowed mother will receive a
                pension if she can prove that she ds dependent. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- She has to prove dependence, and if she has any other income  *n*  corresponding deduction is made from the total
                amount of pension which she would 'Otherwise receive. I hold a letter from a
                widow, whose only son went to the front as a first lieutenant. Prior to joining the
                Expeditionary Forces he was helping to maintain his mother, and he told her that if
                he were killed she would be entitled to a pension of £91. This young man was
                killed whilst fighting with the now .famous 3rd Brigade. The mother states that she
                gave him willingly for his country, but she has living at home with her three
                daughters. One of them is attending school, and the others are learning some
                avocation, which will enable them to support themselves later on. Meanwhile they are
                chiefly dependent on their mother. The mother is the widow of a clergyman, and is in
                receipt of £1 per week, and that amount has been deducted from the pension of
                £91 to which she would have been entitled but for this small income. The son
                who has to support his mother stands in quite as honorable a position as a husband
                supporting his wife. The mother is equally dependent on the son, and I cannot see
                how the Government can separate the relationship of the widowed mother to her son,
                who is her sole support, and the relationship of a wife to her husband. If
                consideration is to be extended to the widow and children, the same consideration
                should be given to widowed mothers. I do not urge that all parents should receive
                pensions regardless of their financial position, hut I venture to say that not more
                than 25 per cent, of the total number of widows would he found to be well provided
                for apart from the help received from the son. The allowance of £1 per week
                received by the clergyman's widow to whom I have referred, is probably not more
                than sufficient to pay house rent, and she would require the full pension to which
                she was entitled through the loss of her son to maintain herself and three
                daughters. It is difficult to prove what proportion of widows are dependent on their
                sons, but if statistics could be obtained they would probably show that fully
                three-fourths of the widows are so dependent. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- If a widow is dependent she will get the pension. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- Will the Minister assure the House that if a widowed mother is able to show
                that she was partly dependent upon the earnings of her son before he went to the war
                she will be entitled to the full pension? 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- We propose to move an amendment in another place to make the Act read that
                dependant means the wife or widow and children of a soldier. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- The widowed mother is justly entitled to the same treatment, and I hope the
                Minister will promise to widen the amendment in that direction. 

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Maribyrnong</small>

.- I desire to say a few words on the subject dealt with by the last three
              speakers. The following letter has been received f rom the Treasury by the widowed
              mother of a young soldier who fell at the front: - 

{: type="A" start="I"}
0. have to inform you that you have been granted a war pension of £26 per
                annum. The Deputy Commissioner of Pensions, Railway Buildings, Flinders-street,
                Melbourne, is being instructed to make arrangements for payment. 

Prior to her son going to the front, this widowed mother had been
            obliged to support an invalid husband for a number of years. The young soldier was an
            only son and, I believe, the only child of the family. The mother is well advanced in
            years. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- She must be drawing another pension. 

##### Mr FENTON:

-- No. 

##### Mr Groom:

-- Did the son contribute to her support? 

##### Mr FENTON:

-- Yes; he was practically her only support. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- Do you know the whole circumstances of the case? Perhaps the woman has not
                told you her own position or that of her husband. 

##### Mr FENTON:

-- I met the lady only through being called upon to assist in drawing up her
                claim for a pension. I know her circumstances, and if any woman is entitled to full
                consideration under the War Pensions Act, this one is. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- There must have been some reason for the Board awarding only £26. 

##### Mr FENTON:

-- In these days of high cost of living, the woman has to pay 15s. for board and
                lodging with a pension of only 10s. per week. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- She must have other income, or she would have been awarded £52. 

##### Mr FENTON:

-- I am safe in saying that this mother is fully fifty-five years of age, and,
                owing to her severe struggle in life in having to nurse and help to maintain an
                invalid husband, she has so worn herself down that she is not fit to undertake work
                to earn her living. While she may be able to earn a few shillings to-day, in a few
                years she willbe almost wholly dependent on the pension of 10s, per week. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- If the honorable member will supply me with the woman's name, I will have
                inquiries made. 

##### Mr FENTON:

-- Even if she has a few extra shillings coming in, I consider that she is still
                entitled to a full pension. The position of the widowed mother is often much harder
                than that of the woman who 

Loses her husband. The great bulk of the men who have gone tothe war
            are under thirty years of age, and, except in rare cases, the wives of, our soldiers are
            young women, full of vigour, and able to undertake work to earn their own living. The
            widowed mother, on the other hand, is often in her declining years. In this case the
            mother has, if I may so put it, a more rightful claim to consideration than would a
            younger woman. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- A mother in her declining years has a right to another pension as well as
                this. 

##### Mr FENTON:

-- That is true. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- Surely that must be taken into consideration? 

##### Mr FENTON:

-- But this mother has not reached that stage. At any rate, in. such times as
                these, under a Bill of this kind, we may afford, I think, to treat the mother very
                well indeed. I shall give the Minister the name of the woman to whom I have
                referred, and I think he will regard it as an exceptionally hard case, though there
                are many others like it. I do not wish to utter anything in the nature of a threat,
                but if an amendment is not made here, I hope our friends in. another place will make
                one, thus assuring to the widowed mother rights to which I think she is entitled.
              

##### Mr MATHEWS:<br><small class="text-muted">Melbourne Ports</small>

. -In fixing the machinery for a. measure of this kind, a certain amount of common
              sense ought to be exercised, as was done in the case of the Invalid and Old-age
              Pensions Act. There ought tobe left with some man the right to discriminate, because,
              as we all know, it is very hard to pass any Act of Parliament that will have universal
              effect. Every case ought to be dealt with on its merits ; and, in view of the
              circumstances related by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, it would appear that
              the Act, as it is at present, is not elastic enough. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- The Commissioner has extensive powers under the Bill. 

##### Mr MATHEWS:

-- The trouble is that the Commissioner is an official. Under the Invalid and
                Old-age Pensions Act there is a Deputy-Commissioner in every State ; and,
                unfortunately, in some of the States, these Deputy-Commissioners deem it their duly
                to save as much as they can to the taxpayers. They do not administer the Act
                according to its spirit, but confine themselves strictly to the letter, and nave an
                idea that they are doing a service to their country if they can deprive some
                individual of a pension." This may seem rather a nasty charge to make; but such
                is the fact. In Victoria, we have, I suppose, actually the best man in Australia tor
                a position of the kind. He deals with «very case on its merits; and I
                understand that, because of this, he is not popular as an official. From what I have
                Sheard, however, if any one endeavours to take down " the Department, he is more
                severe on the delinquent than, perhaps, is any of the other officials; but, at any
                rate, he never throws obstacles in the way of claimants. What we require under Acts
                of this kind is sympathetic administration ; and all of the thousands,, and tens of
                thousands, of cases ought to be dealt with on their merits. In my own constituency
                there is a dear old soul who has two sons at the front. Like a good many
                Australians, they were, when at home, prone to travel about a great deal, (but they
                always did what they, could for their mother, though it might be in rather -a
                careless manner. However, when they went to the front they both made arrangements to
                allow her so much, and the old lady naturally thought that she would have a right to
                a separation allowance. Of course, like many others similarly circumstanced, she
                could not make an affidavit that she was solely dependent on her sons; but she found
                that her other sources of income vanished in view of a feeling that she was getting
                a separation Allowance on account of her sons. At present the position, so far as
                this old lady is concerned, is not so acute; but it would be very different with her
                if anything were to happen to her sons. If the Defence Department will accept no re-
                sponsibility now, it will be hard to fix any responsibility upon them in the future,
                in the absence of proof that the mother was absolutely dependent on these men for
                her support. ' The war has reached such a phase that it is not decent for us to
                " split hairs " in this way. Of course, every one thinks that some one else
                should bear the brunt of the necessary taxation; but when we urge men to go to the
                front, surely we, as a nation, can afford to put cheeseparing on one side in the
                case of dependants and semi-de pendants. It was found necessary to amend the
                original Act, and now we have before us further proposed amendments, which, I admit,
                make the measure much more generous. There is no doubt that, as time goes on,
                experience will show the necessity for further amendments; and I hope the Minister
                will take special note of the cases that have been mentioned. 

##### Mr Sampson:

-- The Commissioner must be controlled by the Act. 

##### Mr MATHEWS:

-- No Parliament yet has passed an Act sufficiently comprehensive to cover every
                possible case; and we must not forget that, in connexion with mothers and wives and
                children,, there is as much sentiment as business. If we cannot cover cases of the
                kind to which reference has been made, I do not care to be asked to mount a platform
                and ask men to go to the front. When I have done so, I have promised that the
                interests of those left behind shall be looked after, and I expect that promise to
                be honoured. There is another case which is interesting. A constituent of mine,
                whose wife had two brothers at the front, enlisted ; and the brothers made
                arrangements for so much to be paid to the mother. While in camp the husband - who,
                by the way, had two children - became sick, and arrived at the conclusion, rightly
                or wrongly, that, owing to the state of his eyes, it was of no use for him to go to
                the front. One of his. tent-mates wrote an anonymous letter tothe Department
                alleging that this man had put tobacco juice in his eyes in order to make them bad;
                and I must say that I am surprised that the Department should take any notice- of
                anonymous letters, the' writers of which can only be described as
                "things." Even if it were evident that a man had done something of this
                kind, his wife and children should not suffer; but he is now in gaol, and those
                dependent on him are without support. My contention is that wives, children, and
                other dependants should receive consideration irrespective' of anything that the
                husband or son has done. I know that in this respect the Act has already been
                considerably broadened; and I suggest that, failing the Commissioner, there should
                be an appeal to somebody or other, in order to insure that each case shall be
                considered on its merits : otherwise, I am afraid the Act will not commend itself to
                those who are asked to urge men to go to the front. 

##### Mr RILEY:<br><small class="text-muted">South Sydney</small>

.- While I congratulate the Government on its effort to decentralize the
              administration, and to make the Act more liberal, I think there are certain blemishes
              that ought to be removed. I think that the widowed mother ought to be placed on the
              same footing as the wife; and there is no doubt, from what we have heard during the
              debate, that that is the wish of the majority of honorable members. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- Honorable members would lead one to suppose that the widowed mother is outside
                the scope of the Act, whereas she is not. 

##### Mr Sampson:

-- .She is, so far as a full pension is concerned. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- She will get a frill pension if it is shown that she should have one. 

##### Mr RILEY:

-- The other night I referred to the case of a lady in my constituency who has
                two sons at the front, but who, because she has an invalid husband, who has been in
                an asylum for seventeen years, is debarred from receiving anything on account of the
                one son who is unmarried. In another case, a woman whose son is at the front was
                refused any allowance because she rents a large house, portions of which she sublets
                in order to enable herself to live rent free. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- Why should "she have an allowance if she, as is admitted, has other income
                ? 

##### Mr RILEY:

-- She merely rents this house, and lets portions of it out in order to enable
                her to pay the rent. 

##### Mr Jensen:

-- You will discover what this War Pensions Act means in a couple of years, when
                you have to foot the Bill. 

##### Mr RILEY:

-- What we are trying to do is to remove anomalies in the Act; and I suggest that
                the two cases which I have cited are hard cases for which provision should be made.
                I believe that the country would indorse our action if we placed widowed mothers on
                the same plane as wives. A mother is often called upon to make a greater sacrifice
                than is made by a wife. As a rule, the soldier's wife is a young woman, while
                his mother has spent her strength in the bringing up of her family, and, on the
                death of her son, loses her sole support. Should we, when a son has given his life
                for the country, cavil at the payment of a. small pension to his mother  *1*  In my opinion, the widowed mother should be on the
                same footing as the wife, and the aged father who has be,come too infirm to work,
                and depends on his sons for his support, should be in the same position as"?he
                widowed mother. I understand that the Government is prepared to move certain
                amendments in the Senate, and should the Bill return to us unamended, we shall have
                a right to protest against some of its. provisions. 

Question resolved in the affirmative.

### INSCRIBED STOCK BILL

{:#subdebate-40-0}
#### Second Reading

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and .Treasurer &middot; Wide Bay &middot; ALP</small>

-- I move - That this Bill be now read a second time. This is purely a machinery
              measure tomake necessary amendments in the Inscribed Stock Act 1911-13, and to
              extendits provisions in certain directions. 

Section 5 of the principal Act limits, the rate of interest on stock to  *£3*  10s. per centum per annum, and obviously, aswe
            are now asking the public to lend us money at 4 \ per cent., it is necessary to* amend
            this provision, which is done by clause 2. 

Then, again, as at present stock cannot be legally transferred in any amount
            lessthan £50, to popularize Commonwealthloans it is proposed to amend the
            principal* Act to allow of transfers of stock in such, amounts as may be approved by the
            GovernorGeneral. Thus we intend to provide for the transference of small amounts* of
            stock and for the conversion of bonds into inscribed stock, and of stock intobonds as
            may suit the convenience of the. lender. 

In connexion with the issue of Commonwealth loans it is important that the-, lenders
            should know how they stand in relation to taxation. We are satisfied that the States
            cannot impose taxation.upon interest received from Commonwealth securities, and it is
            the intention of the Government that persons who lend money to the Commonwealth shall
            not be compelled to pay back to us in the form of taxation what they receive as
            interest. The Bill provides that stock - and bonds and interest thereon shall not be
            liable to stamp duty under any law of the Commonwealth or of a State, arid' that the
            interest shall not be liable to- either State or Commonwealth income tax. There may be a
            difference of opinion as to the wisdom of this arrangement; but, in my opinion, it is
            best to make the interest on the Commonwealth loan free from taxation. 

##### Mr Sampson:

-- Why should it be free from taxation ? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- The lenders, both small and great, will know that during the term of the loan
                they will receive. the net rate of interest which we offer for their money, and
                that, however other securities may fluctuate, this investment will not change in
                value owing to any alteration in taxation. As the loan affects the credit of the
                country, it is advisable that it should not fluctuate in value for such a reason.
              

##### Mr Sampson:

-- Where is revenue to come from in the future if Government securities are not
                to be taxed? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- Happily the Commonwealth has not yet borrowed money from any private person.
              

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- The Prime Minister seems confident that he will not have to do any borrowing
                in respect to other matters. 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- I do not pretend to any great financial knowledge beyond the advice I receive
                and my own rough and ready experience, but I ask the people of Australia to believe
                that there is no hope of financing the present situation without heavy borrowing. We
                declared this afternoon that we would see the war through to the bitter end, and I
                know of no way in which sufficient revenue can be raised by taxation to finance our
                obligations. Imagine what it would cost if we had to raise and equip 200,000 men. We
                could not do that out of revenue. It is therefore our duty to make the credit of the
                Commonwealth such that our citizens, rich and poor, will be willing to invest their
                money in Commonwealth loans. Those who cannot fight at the front will be given an
                opportunity to make sacrifices to assist the financing of the Commonwealth
                obligations. The proposal to exempt from income tax interest on the loan is made to
                secure the absolute certainty of the whole amount being subscribed. In my opinion it
                was a right thing to offer to pay 4$ per cent, interest for the money borrowed, and
                the fact that the short-termed Imperial loan is down to £97§ gives an idea
                of the state of the money market. 

Honorable members will recollect that last year we passed an Act imposing duty of
            probate on the estates of deceased persons. This Bill provides that war loan holdings
            shall be accepted at par for the payment of such duty. This should prove a great
            convenience.. When a large estate has to be realized to pay probate duty, the market is
            often unnecessarily disturbed; but the acceptance of war loan stock at par for the
            payment of such duty will prevent that, and will prove of distinct advantage to the
            beneficiaries. This statement deals with practically all the provisions of the Bill,
            which is purely a machinery measure, and has been considered very carefully, so that, I
            think, the whole ground is covered. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">Parramatta</small>

-- I understand that the Bill is intended to adjust machinery which has been in
              existence for some time to the new and extraordinary conditions that we have to face,
              and it may therefore be allowed to pass. No doubt the proposal to exempt from taxation
              interest on the war loan is debatable. On the whole, the exemption ought to give
              satisfaction, as I understand that all the States free their loan transactions from
              income tax. Whether, in these circumstances, and at this time, that should be done, is
              a point that is open to argument. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- I admit that. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- At the same time, the real way of looking at it is that the exemption is part
                of the price we have to pay for the loan. What it will amount to when some of the
                higher graduations that have been suggested in the papers are concerned, I do not
                pretend to say. Instead of 4^ per cent., we may be paying actually 5 per cent., or
                something like that. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- It may be more than that. I would ask the right honorable gentleman to
                consider what the position would be if the investment were made out of this
                year's income, and 25 per cent, were deducted by way of taxation from that
                income before" its investment. If a person whose income is involved in the.
                higher grade of taxation desired to invest in this loan, he would have only 75 per
                cent, of his income to invest. Can the honorable member calculate the interest on
                that? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- I hope we may soon have the right honorable gentleman's full financial
                proposals bet ore us. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Next week. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- This Bill provides for the necessary machinery, no matter what the amount of
                the tax or the loan may be. This machinery is necessary for the purpose of floating
                loans of any kind, both now and hereafter; and it follows on the old beaten track
                kept to for so many years by all the States, though the Commonwealth is entering
                upon a new career. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- We have not yet been on the market at all. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- My honorable friend is always saying that, and I am always trying to remind
                him that he may have to go on to the market yet, even, in connexion with the note
                issue, the full sequel of which has not yet appeared, though it will appear
                by-and-by. It is scarcely worth while opening up that debatable ground at the
                present juncture, and though the Treasurer has difficulties ahead, we need only
                concern ourselves with what is immediately before us in the way of adequately
                financing our war preparations. Any proposal to do that will, I hope, always commend
                itself to the House, and to the reasoned judgment of the people as a whole. 

##### Mr GROOM:<br><small class="text-muted">Darling Downs</small>

-- As the Treasurer has pointed out, this Bill simply makes an amendment in the
              existing law, in order that he may have the elasticity he desires in connexion with
              the proposed loan flotation. Under the existing law, the Treasurer is limited to the
              payment of 31/2 per cent, interest, and the Government's aim is to remove that
              restriction so as to be able to offer higher rates of interest, in order to attract
              the requisite loan money for the purpose of carrying on the war. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- The honorable member is quite right. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- I think no one will adversely criticise that proposal. Further elasticity is
                to be sought by repealing section 32. The present position is that no transfer of
                stock of a smaller amount than £50 can be made without the permission of the
                Treasurer. If this Bill is passed, that provision will be repealed. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- The now proposed minimum is £10, but we may come down to £5. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- The law at the present time makes £50 the minimum. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- That is so. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- The Bill also will enable the Government to issue Treasurybonds from time to
                time.Under the existing Act, that provision does not exist, and it is for that
                reason that section 51a is inserted in this Bill. The clause gives as wide a
                direction as the Government could desire. A most material point is that mentioned by
                the honorable member for Parramatta providing that interest on the loan shall not be
                liable to income tax under either Commonwealth or State laws. That is to say, that
                it is the intention of the Government, if the Commonwealth income tax is imposed,
                that people need not include the sum received as loan interest in their income
                returns as part of their taxable incomes. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- That is so. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- It will not be subject to taxation, not even if it has the effect of placing
                an individual in a higher scale. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- No. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- It will not affect the income as to taxation in any way. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- No. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- That provision will undoubtedly come as a considerable relief, also the
                declaration that the States must not lay hands upon this interest income for their
                purposes either. It has been already held in the High Court that the States have no
                power to tax the incomes of Federal servants. That is the law at the present time.
                The law gives a general protection to Commonwealth instrumentalities and agencies.
                If the States had power to tax they would have the power to destroy. They would have
                the power to impede and hinder Federal agencies, and I think the Prime Minister is
                quite right in his statement that if the States had power of taxation, and sought to
                exercise it to anunlimited extent, they might considerably impair Commonwealth
                securities. I think it is only fair and proper that the Com- monwealth should seek
                to throw some protection over its own instrumentalities. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- May I say - and in this I am expressing but my own opinion - that I think it
                is a mistake that the Government of a country, which has the defence of the country
                to maintain, should be limited in regard to its taxation. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- We have no limitation in our power of taxation. The States have very serious
                limitations. It is a question as to the extent to which we should exercise it.
              

##### Mr Glynn:

-- The power of taxation is an independent one. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- The Commonwealth power is an independent power. 

##### Mr Glynn:

-- So, too, the State. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- But the State is restricted, inasmuch as it has no power of taxation in regard
                to Customs and Excise. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- I put, in all friendliness, the question as to whether a Government,
                responsible for the defence of the nation, should have any limitation placed upon
                its power of taxation over any citizen within its country. 

##### Mr Glynn:

-- The point is that the States have no assets. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- As a matter of fact, under our existing Constitution the Commonwealth has
                practically unlimited powers of taxation; but the point raised here is that the
                States have also their own powers of taxation, which might he exercised in a manner
                calculated to impede or hinder, or impair, Commonwealth instrumentalities or
                agencies. What is being done in this declaratory clause is to make it clear to the
                States that, as far as this loan is concerned, the citizens of Australia will have
                unlimited power of investment without being interfered with in any way - that they
                will have full freedom of action for the purposes of investment. So far as the
                Commonwealth public services are concerned, similar freedom and immunity exists, but
                the Commonwealth very properly maintains this position: That all public servants and
                officials shall be upon the same footing as the rest of the citizens of the
                Commonwealth, and the States were given power by Commonwealth legislation to tax
                their incomes just as they tax the incomes of the other residents within their
                States. In that way equity is done. But here we are dealing with an entirely
                different problem. The war has. to be financed, and as Australia is thrown upon her
                own resources, the desire is to induce everybody who has capital to assist in
                financing this war, and the desire of the Government in making this exemption is to
                encourage people, not only from motives of patriotism, but from motives of
                self-interest to come in. To that extent I can see no objection to the proposition,
                although it would be open to argument, were we dealing with the subject of loan
                interest apart from the war. 

I think the Government, if this measure becomes law, will obtain the
            elasticity that they desire, and the proposal is one which will receive assistance,
            rather than hostility, from me. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Bendigo</small>

.- Any one who has followed the history of Federation must feel a sense of
              disappointment that, after all that was said regarding the credit of the Commonwealth
              in the matter of borrowing money, and as to the ability of the Commonwealth to borrow
              money at lower rates of interest than any of the States, we should now be offering
              terms very much higher than any of the States have offered for a long time. 

##### Mr Archibald:

-- That is on account of the war. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- I know we are in exceptional times. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Can the honorable member give an instance where the rate is lower ? 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- Not in recent loans. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Within a year of the war. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- I suppose if we take the whole of the State loans of Victoria, the rate
                offered in this loan is higher than has been paid by the States. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- No. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- I think the right honorable gentleman will find that it is so. The State of
                Victoria does not pay 41/2 per cent, interest for all the loans running at the
                present time. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Recent loans. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- I am not talking about recent loans. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- The honorable member is not taking into account the expenses of flotation,
                which often run to about £2 10s. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- I recognise that we are passing through exceptional times, but I express my
                sense of disappointment that the Commonwealth, on the first occasion of its entering
                the money market, is not going to realize the expectations of those who took an
                active part in the advocacy of Federation, that it would be able to raise, at 3 per
                cent., all the money it required. ' Even in this time of crisis, it should he
                possible to float a loan of £20,000,000 at per cent, without offering investors
                additional inducements. The Government, however, are holding out the special
                inducement that interest on this loan shall be free from income tax and stamp duty.
                It is rumoured in the press that the income tax rates will run up to 5s. in the
                £1 in the case of incomes in excess of £7,500 per annum, so that a large
                investor in this loan, who draws from it by way of interest £10,000 per annum,
                will receive a gift amounting probably to over £1,000 per annum. He will secure
                over 5 per cent, for his money. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- If the amount invested had been accumulated out of his income this year, it
                would be taxed. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- The Government would collect income tax on the amount he had earned during the
                previous twelve months, but this loan will run over fifty years. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- No. The currency of the loan is ten years. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- During the whole of that time, investors in it, having regard to the exemption
                from income tax "and stamp duty, will earn 5 per cent. The  *Herald*  a few days ago reported a meeting of a
                prosperous mining company - the Al Gold Mines Company No Liability - at which a
                dividend representing £16,229 in respect of the preceding twelve months was
                declared. One of the speakers at that meeting was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  L.</inline> A. Adamson, who, I think, is a member of the Legislative Council of
                Victoria, and who, according to the  *Herald,* 
                said that if the proposed taxation became law, the only plan would be for the
                company to invest its money in £10 Treasury-bonds, which would be free of
                income tax, and these bonds could be distributed, instead of cheques, among the
                shareholders. Is there any chance of the tax being evaded in that way? 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Not the slightest. The gentleman in question was merely blowing bubbles in the
                air. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- The Treasurer has told us that the war can be financed only by borrowing as
                proposed by the Government. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- I said that that was my opinion. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- The honorable member for Calare, who, I understand, is interested in banking,
                made the interesting statement that the Associated Banks, if allowed to issue their
                own notes, would be prepared to provide this £20,000,000. 

##### Mr Archibald:

-- The Associated Banks did not say anything of the kind. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- The honorable member informed the House that he was speaking on behalf of a
                banker in New South Wales. 

##### Mr Archibald:

-- Some old woman. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- Such statements cannot be brushed aside in that way. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- It was only so much nonsense. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- Does the Treasurer say that the Associated Banks could not raise the money in
                the circumstances indicated by the honorable member? 

##### Mr Glynn:

-- They could not float a loan of £20,000,000. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- Not if they were allowed to issue their own paper money in respect of it ?
              

##### Mr Glynn:

-- It would be bad business. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- It seemed to me that if the Associated Banks could do such a thing the
                Commonwealth Government should be able to finance the war in the same way. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- We have done it beyond the dreams of the most sanguine. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- The Treasurer is referring to the note issue with its gold backing. Would it
                be unbusiness-like to have a special war note issue, coupled with direct taxation,
                to provide a fund to redeem a certain amount per annum? 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- It would be a delightful way of financing the war if the honorable member
                could tell us how the necessary money, could be raised by taxation. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- If we desired to raise £20,000,000, could we not obtain the money in the
                way I have mentioned, at the same time imposing a special tax to enable us to redeem
                it at the rate of £1,000,000 per annum? Does the Treasurer say that that would
                not be a sound, business-like proposition? . 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- When the taxation measures are introduced it will be for the honorable member
                to say whether he is in favour of increasing the proposed taxation to provide such a
                sinking fund. My own opinion is that to do such a thing would be to cripple the
                country for a time. 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- I differ from that view. I have heard what Germany has been able to do by
                means of her internal note issue, and if she can do it I fail to understand why we
                should not be able to act similarly. Another point to which I wish to draw attention
                is the effect which the floating of this loan at a high rate of interest is likely
                to have on the States when they desire to borrow in the same market. Then, again, is
                it not likely that money now invested on mortgage, in industry, and in various
                companies will be withdrawn and invested in the war loan, to the detriment of the
                country? 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- That objection would apply also to taxation. What is the point of the
                honorable member's criticism ? 

##### Mr HAMPSON:

-- I contend that since the Commonwealth is offering 4£ per cent, it should
                not be necessary for it to hold out these extra inducements to the people to invest
                in a war loan, and that, instead of going into the market to borrow, we might have
                financed the war in another way. 

##### Mr ATKINSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wilmot</small>

.- I have no opposition to offer to the pronosed war loan. I am very glad that the
              Treasurer has decided to raise it, and I hope and believe that there will be a great
              demand for our inscribed stock. At the same time, we cannot close our eyes to the fact
              that the floating of a loan of £20,000,000 on the local market must more or less
              entrench upon the working capital of the country. I am afraid that many people from
              whom it is expected to collect heavy income tax will avoid that tax to a large extent
              by investing in this loan. This might prove highly detrimental to many small farmers
              who haVe mortgages on their property. An investor who has loaned £20,000 or
              £30,000 in various amounts upon the security of farming properties will probably
              call in that money if it is now falling due, and put it into the Government war loan.
              If that is done to any extent farmers will suffer very serious hardship. Money is not
              obtainable at anything like the rate at which it could be secured some years ago. It
              may be said that even if no war loan were floated, mortgagees would call in their
              mortgages as they fell due, and ask the farmers to pay a higher rate of interest.
            

##### Mr Wise:

-- That is a certainty. Dic the honorable member ever hear of a mortgagee who was
                prepared to renew a mortgage at the old rate of interest in a rising market? 

##### Mr ATKINSON:

-- I have not, but I believe there are mortgagees who are prepared to renew
                existing mortgages at 5 per cent, for some considerable time. If, instead of doing
                so, they decide to invest in the war loan, mortgagors will be placed in a
                difficulty, since it is hard to raise money at 5 per cent., even on the best of
                landed securities. I am concerned regarding the position of the small farmers, who
                are the backbone of the country, and represent one of the most deserving sections of
                the community. 

##### Mr Wise:

-- Does the honorable member suggest that the proposed loan should be withdrawn ?
              

##### Mr ATKINSON:

-- Certainly not; but I am anxious to put these facts before the Treasurer so
                that, in framing his income tax proposals, he will endeavour to make them as
                equitable as possible. No one can be ignorant of many of the great difficulties
                which confront the Treasurer at the present time. He has our sympathy. But this is a
                time of stress. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- We have not yet begun to feel the pinch. 

##### Mr ATKINSON:

-- Then I hope that the. right honorable gentleman will make his income tax rates
                as low as possible. Any one who is called upon to change his mortgage will find it
                difficult to raise money at 5 per cent., although a few years ago plenty of money
                was offering at 4^ per cent. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Does not. the price of money rise and fall in the market like anything else?
              

##### Mr ATKINSON:

-- "Unfortunately it does; but the interest rate has been rising for some
                time, and the money market is growing tighter. There is no prospect of any immediate
                reduction in the interest rate, and in these special circumstances I ask the
                Treasurer to take care that the incidence of taxation is made as equitable as
                possible. A tax of 5s. in the £1- 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member is now going beyond the scope of the Bill. He would have
              been in order in referring to that matter when the Loan Bill was before the House.
            

##### Mr ATKINSON:

-- I shall conclude by asking the Treasurer to make a note of the points I have
                raised, and I am sure that if he can do anything to meet the position of small
                farmers and others with mortgages on their property he will do so. 

##### Mr GLYNN:<br><small class="text-muted">Angas</small>

-- I notice that the Treasurer is issuing bonds, but I am not aware whether he
              intends to allow any registration. Treasury-bills very often are issued so that scrip
              can pass from hand to hand ; but there is also power to register at the Treasury, and
              then the coupons must be indorsed, or they will not be capable of being cashed. That
              is a protection to the public. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- I think the bond will be a personal security payable to the hearer. 

##### Mr GLYNN:

-Are there not to be any coupons ? 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Only for the payment of interest. 

##### Mr GLYNN:

-- If they are lost, they can be cashed by anybody. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- The Commonwealth Bank will accept and keep the securities free of charge.
              

##### Mr GLYNN:

-- That seems a roundabout way of attaining the same object. There is a simpler
                method - registration, to prevent cashing without indorsement. I think there is an
                idea abroad that Commonwealth securities are exempt from State taxation. I believe
                that is correct, but a reciprocal obligation applies, and if the State cannot tax a
                document of instrumentality without the Commonwealth's permission, the
                Commonwealth cannot tax without the State's permission. I do not know whether
                the Treasurer has come to any arrangement with the States. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- I shall not give up any of the Commonwealth's powers. 

##### Mr GLYNN:

-- I quite agree with that view; but the States are as much within their sphere
                of taxation as we are, although the paramount consideration at present is that of
                defence. In this Bill we say that there is to be no taxation of income derived from
                scrip which the Commonwealth issues. The States, seeing a Commonwealth loan being
                issued at 41/2 per cent., are raising their rates of interest. Within the last week
                the State Treasurers have discussed the issue of Treasury-bills, bearing interest at
                41/2 per cent., on what they consider to be as good terms as the Commonwealth
                offers. Do the Commonwealth Government intend to try to tax income derived from
                State securities? The States are entitled to know the Government's intentions in
                that respect, so that there need be no un certainty about the competitive value of
                the stock they place on the market. I suggest that there ought to be a common
                understanding between the Treasurers of the States and the Commonwealth. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Our loan is for expenditure on defence of the country, and we must maintain
                all our rights. 

##### Mr GLYNN:

-- In other words, we reserve the right to tax the securities of the States,
                although we say the States are not to tax Commonwealth securities, and we plead, in
                justification of that attitude, the necessities of defence. I quite appreciate the
                Treasurer's position. He was confronted by States anxious to' borrow, and
                there is a lack of financial coordination, which, no doubt, has hampered him. Steps
                should be taken to check that competition in the one market between organs of
                government in an emergency such as the present. We are obliged to deny to the States
                a right which we seek for ourselves, simply because we are driven by the competitive
                conditions on the market to adopt that course. I do not intend to say anything in
                justification or criticism of that policy; but I hope that some understanding may be
                arrived at between the Treasurer and the States, so that when they float their
                stocks the exact value of them in relation to taxation will be known.

Motion (by  **Mr. Fisher)**  proposed - 

  >That this Bill be now read a third time. 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

-- Do I rightly understand that there is no limit to the interest payable on
              Treasurybills - that the Government can pay any interest they choose? 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- That is so, but I think it is necessary that the Government should have that
                discretionary power. 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:

-- It seems that we are handing over a very big powerto the Government. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- I think that in ft Loan Bill we can still condition a loan. 


 **Mr. FISHER** (Wide Bay- Prime Minister and Treasurer)
            [5.591. - The Treasurer cannot issue any loan unless it is specifically authorized
            by Act of Parliament. 

##### Sir John Forrest:

-- Will that apply to Treasury-bills ? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- It will apply to all money borrowed. I can relieve the minds of honorable
                members by assuring them that I shall not issue any stock without the authority of
                Parliament, even if any loophole for so doing does exist. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a third time.

### TREASURY-BILLS BILL (No. 2)

{:#subdebate-41-0}
#### Second Reading

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Treasurer &middot; Wide Bay &middot; ALP</small>

-- I move - 

That this Bill be now read a second time. 

Although this Bill contains a number of clauses, it is entirely a machinery measure.
            Under the present Act, the Treasurer is obliged to pay interest quarterly on all loans.
            These payments are too frequent, and in these times are found very inconvenient. The
            main purpose of this Bill is to enable the Treasurer to establish a current account of
            Treasury-bills, interest to be paid on the daily balance, instead of issuing a separate
            Treasurybill on each occasion on which advances are made from the Australian Notes
            Account. This will obviate a great deal of complication and detail. 

##### Mr GROOM:<br><small class="text-muted">Darling Downs</small>

.- The Bill goes much further than the Treasurer has indicated. Under section 8 of
              the Australian Notes Act, moneys which are derived from the issue of the notes are
              paid into the Australian Notes Fund, and money standing to the credit of that account
              is held by the Treasurer. Not less than one-quarter of the amount must be kept in
              gold. The balance may be invested by the Treasurer, either on deposit or in securities
              of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, or any State. If Treasury-bills are issued
              under the Act at the present moment, the Treasurer may invest portion of the Notes
              Fund in such bills, and then he has to hold in his possession those securities, so
              "that every time money is borrowed from the Notes Account a separate bill has to
              be deposited, and interest paid on it quarterly. This Bill removes the provision for
              quarterly payments of interest, and provides that when the Treasurer desires to borrow
              money from the Notes Fund he need not issue a Treasury-bill at all. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- If I issued a Treasurybill, I would have to use it for loan purposes. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- Yes; but the intention of the Australian Notes Act was that the currency
                should be secured by having either gold, bank deposits or securities of the
                Commonwealth or States, or of the United Kingdom - that was the whole basis. Under
                the Bill, the Treasurer, so far as moneys which are borrowed from the Notes Fund are
                concerned, need not issue any Treasury-bills; and probably what he would do would be
                to practically make a book entry. As a matter of fact, it would be a regular current
                account with the Commonwealth, pretty much as a current account in a bank; and from
                time to time, when the Treasurer borrowed, there would be a debit, and when the loan
                was refunded there would be a credit to the Treasury. I understand the reason for
                the alteration. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- It makes it more mobile. We safeguard the Notes Fund in the Bill. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- As a matter of convenience to the Treasurer, this Bill will give great relief;
                and no doubt it will facilitate very much his arrangements with the Treasury. But
                thereis another aspect which the Treasurer ought to consider. The intention of the
                Australian Notes Act was to regulate currency - to provide a note currency backed up
                by the credit of the whole Commonwealth. The Treasurer, in his capacity of
                Treasurer, is a sort of trustee for the currency fund. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- He is not a sort of trustee - he is one. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- He is, in effect, made so by the Act. In Queensland, where this idea was
                originally carried out, there was created an entirely independent board, consisting
                of the Speaker, the Treasurer, and a third person appointed under the Treasury-Bills
                Act 1893 which authorized the issue of Treasury-bills to secure the retirement of
                notes. I cannot help feeling that, if there were an independent board vested with
                entire control of the currency, they would insist on having a bond for every penny
                that was borrowed. There is, to some extent, a danger - though it may not be at
                present a serious danger - that people might confuse the relationship of the
                Treasurer in his capacity as trustee for the notes account, and as the custodian of
                the Consolidated 

Revenue. There may be a danger of weakening in the public mind the
            feeling of security in the basis of our currency legislation in such abolition of the
            machinery provision requiring the deposit of securities. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- I should be the last to do anything of that kind. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- I think the Treasurer may urge in reply that the Bill is only permissive, and
                not compulsory. Although the Act provides that this accountkeeping can be carried
                out, it is only optional with the Treasurer; he, as custodian of the Notes Fund,
                will still have power to require Treasury -bills if necessary. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Do you not see the difficulty of issuing Treasury-bills ? 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- I see the difficulty which arises from the fact that the Treasurer, in his
                capacity as Treasurer, is continually making loans from himself as trustee of the
                fund. If there were a separate independent body, such as a corporation, there is no
                doubt they would take the stand that for every penny issued there would have to be a
                bond to represent it. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- The honorable member must be careful; he spoke of loans from the Treasurer to
                myself as Treasurer. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- The difficulty arises from the fact that the Treasurer occupies two
                capacities. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- How would it do to have two Treasurers? 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- I think I expressed my opinion, on a former occasion, that it would have been
                better to constitute an independent currency commission. However, what I have
                pointed out seems to me to suggest the only element of danger, though, of course, I
                speak without any actual experience on the Treasury side. 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

-- The Treasury-bills Act gives the GovernorGeneral in Council power to issue
              Treasury-bills for raising by way of loan any money authority to borrow which has been
              granted by an Act. Unless there is authority to borrow money in this way,
              Treasury-bills cannot be issued. I now have to refer to what has become very common in
              the Treasury, namely, borrowing from the Notes Fund; but I think that the provision in
              the measure cannot give the Treasurer any power to borrow money from the Notes Fund,
              unless for purposes which have been authorized by an Act of Parliament. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Certainly not. 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:

-- At the same time, I think the Prime Minister will agree that what is proposed
                makes the dealings between the' Treasurer and the note issue a little more loose
                - if I may use such a word. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- Say that it makes it more flexible. 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:

-- Very well, I shall use the word "flexible." In fact, it has become a
                practice of the Treasury to treat the note issue fund, so long as the money is
                available, as a sort of current account, though I am inclined to think that payments
                into the current account are not so common at present. I do not know that it is wise
                for the Treasurer todo this. By this Bill the Treasurer can borrow from the Notes
                Trust Fund and merely make a book entry; and those in charge of the gold have no
                negotiable documents representing the gold issued. Say that £100,000 in
                sovereigns is taken out of the Notes Trust Fund for the purposes of the Treasury
                under authority of a Loan Act, there will, under this Bill, be no negotiable
                documents held by the custodians of the gold representing that number of sovereigns.
                This comes about because the right honorable gentleman is the custodian of the gold,
                and at the same time Treasurer of the Commonwealth. The practice to which I have
                been accustomed when the State or Commonwealth Government has borrowed from Trust
                Funds, Has been to deposit a negotiable document to the value of the sum borrowed;
                so that if the worst came to the worst, money could be raised on it, or it could be
                sold. Of course, I know that under existing circumstances such a document could be
                made out by the Treasurer at any time. If there were a rush on the Treasury for
                gold, he could at once make out such an instrument as I speak of, and have it
                negotiated; but the practice has been to lodge such a document at the time the money
                is borrowed. The Treasurer proposes merely to keep a debtor and creditor account of
                the transactions. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- To the extent to which those transactions affect the Consolidated Revenue.
              

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:

-- No doubt the method proposed is the easier method ; but I am not sure that it
                is the wiser one. If there were a Commissioner in charge of the notes gold, he would
                require the deposit of a negotiable document as security for any advance. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- He would get a certificate. 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:

-- But, in this case, no provision is made for the issue of even a certificate.
                There are to be merely book entries. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- There will be a check on all transactions. 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:

-- Some tangible negotiable security should be given when money is borrowed from
                the Notes Fund. Another matter to which I direct attention is the inadvisability of
                having con- . tinual borrowing transactions from the Notes Fund. If the Treasurer
                were dealing with a financial institution, he would not borrow one day and pay back
                the next, and have a series of small transactions; he would borrow a considerable
                sum to carry him on for a certain period. 

##### Mr Archibald:

-- This is an exceptional time. 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:

-- Yes; but the fewer the transactions in connexion with the Notes Fund the
                better. There should not be daily borrowings, but merely borrowings now and again in
                considerable sums as the money is required. That would be better than to treat the
                threefourths available as a current account. At the same time, I am not prepared to
                ask the House to oppose this proposal. 

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Treasurer &middot; Wide Bay &middot; ALP</small>

-- I assure the House that it is not only not my intention to reduce the gold
              reserve - below the statutory 25 per cent. - but it is not my intention to reduce it
              below one-third. I should not make any reduction below onethird without communicating
              my purpose to the House. As to the other point, it is only a small amount that will be
              dealt with in the way proposed. 

##### Mr Groom:

-- Will there be Treasurybills for the larger amounts? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- No. The right honorable member for Swan spoke as if we had no need for daily
                transactions, but he does not know what happens in these times. We have to finance
                the States as well as the Commonwealth, and the call for defence expenditure may
                have to be met most unexpectedly. Happily there are plenty of resources. Should
                there seem to be any danger in the present practice, I shall give the House an
                opportunity of considering it. 

##### Mr Groom:

-- When a large sum is involved for any specific purpose, will Treasury-bills be
                issued ? 

##### Mr FISHER:

-- No. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time. 


 *In Committee:* 


Clauses l and 2 agreed to. 

Clause 3 (Borrowing money from Australian Notes Account without issue of
            Treasury-bills). 

##### Mr GLYNN:<br><small class="text-muted">Angas</small>

.- The effect of the Bill is practically to limit the Treasurer to the amount of
              the Treasury notes issued. Another effect that there is not so very much in is that if
              you do not give Treasury-bills, and there is an appreciation of value, you will
              deprive the Treasurer of the advantage which he might gain by going into the market.
              But he reserves to himself the power to fix the interest. The interest is a check on
              the Treasurer. Why should it not be up to the level of the Treasurybill? Then the Bill
              will be consistent with itself. As it is, you might have 1/2 per cent, interest, and
              the whole security would be gone. 

Clause agreed to. 

Clause 4, and title, agreed to.

### OFFICERS' COMPENSATION BILL

{:#subdebate-42-0}
#### Second Reading

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Treasurer &middot; Wide Bay &middot; ALP</small>

-- I move - 

That this Bill be now read a second time. 

The object of the Bill is to provide for compensation to certain people who have
            suffered in various ways. Some of the men to whose relatives compensation is proposed to
            be paid lost their lives on the  *Endeavour,*  one was
            a military officer who, unfortunately, lost his life while serving in Canada, and
            another is a special allowance to the widow of a military officer who died in South
            Australia. The others are persons who have suffered in exceptional circumstances, and
            the Executive, after the closest investigation into those circumstances, think they are
            entitled to compensation. I shall not give details, but I assure honorable members that
            great care has been exercised by the 

Government, and that they feel justified in asking that this Bill should be passed.
          

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">Parramatta</small>

-- I rise to support the Bill very cordially. The amounts do not appear to be
              excessive, but, on the contrary, seem to be small. I would like to direct the
              attention of the Prime Minister to the case of the widow of Colonel Le Mesurier. That
              seems to be very small indeed. Last year we gave to the representatives of a gentleman
              a little higher, nominally in command, an amount, I think, of £1,200 or
              £1,500; but for Colonel Le Mesurier's widow the amount provided is only
              £362. I do not want to make any distinctions at all; but I see that the father of
              J. Hamilton, formerly labourer at "Woodlark Island, is to get £390. 

##### Mr Bamford:

-- It has been based on an actuarial computation. 

##### Mr Tudor:

-- I understand that Hamilton did not come under the Workmen's Compensation
                Act, and this is the amount lie would have received under that Act. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- I am not complaining that it is too much; but I am saying that the widow of
                Colonel Le Mesurier should, I think, have received better treatment. That officer
                went through the Boer War, and was one of our coolest and most intrepid troop
                leaders. He fought many a brave battle, and his whole ambitions were centred in the
                Defence Department. I know that bis widow is not well off, and I cannot help feeling
                that the Government might have been a little more generous. 

##### Mr Glynn:

--  **His**  widow is dead, and the provision
                should, therefore, be for the children of the widow. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- I was not aware that she was dead. 

##### Mr Glynn:

-- Yes, she died a month ago. 

##### Mr Groom:

-- The Bill will have to be amended, then. 

##### Mr Tudor:

-- We were not aware that she had died. 

##### Mr Fisher:

-- The amendment can be made in Committee. 

##### Sir ROBERT BEST:<br><small class="text-muted">Kooyong</small>

-- I want to bring under notice the case of Harrisson. If I remember rightly, he
              was the biologist on the  *Endeavour.*  We are all
              aware of the deplorable circumstances connected with that vessel. In that case, in
              addition to £500 under the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act, it is now
              intended to vote only £20. I can only ask that the full circumstances of this
              particular case, and of the widow, be investigated. 

##### Mr Tudor:

-- The amount fixed is equal to two years' pay in each case - Harrisson,
                Pirn, and Dannevig. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- What I cannot understand is, in the case of these men we are giving
                compensation equal to two years' salary, and in the case of an ordinary labourer
                three years. 

##### Sir ROBERT BEST:

-- I cannot pretend, at the present moment, to bring all the circumstances before
                my honorable friends, because I have not the facts before me; but I would ask that
                this case - which I know is a very serious one - might be looked into a little
                further. 

##### Mr GROOM:<br><small class="text-muted">Darling Downs</small>

-- I would plead with the Prime Minister that, as the principle of the
              Workmen's Compensation Act is compensation on the basis of three years' pay,
              in the case .of Pim Harrisson, and Dannevig the rule should not have been departed
              from. I think in Colonel Reade's case the recommendation was considerably more.
            

##### Mr Page:

-- You are awfully anxious about the officers; but you have not a word to say
                about the privates. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- It is grossly unfair for the honorable member to say that. Are not the
                officers entitled to justice? 

##### Mr Page:

-- Yes; and so are the other men; and you are not saying a word about them.
              

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- As a matter of fact, they are provided for, and their representatives get
                compensation on the basis of three years' wages. 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- I understood that this was a deliberative assembly, in which we were entitled
                to put each case before the Committee; but, according to the honorable member for
                Maranoa, it is an offence to claim fair treatment for certain people. In regard to
                the cases mentioned, and particularly the cases of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs.
                  Pim</inline> and  **Mrs. Harrisson,**  I would ask
                the Prime Minister if he does not think that more sympathetic consideration could be
                given by the Government? 

Question resolved in the affirmative.

### SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT

Motion (by  **Mr. Fisher)**  proposed - 

That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Wednesday next. 

##### Mr FINLAYSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Brisbane</small>

. -I appeal to the Prime Minister to give us an adjournment over next week. We have
            been anticipating a recess for several weeks past. It was fully believed that, by the
            end of July at least, honorable members coming from distant States would havean
            opportunity to visit their constituencies. We have been here now for four months, and it
            is but fair that honorable members coming from distant electorates should be given such
            an opportunity. I should not press my request if there was any hope that the House would
            adjourn after next week. If  *a*  financial statement
            is made next week it will probably be followed by a long discussion. There are many
            reasons why it would be well to adjourn over next week. 

##### Mr PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Maranoa</small>

.- I echo the sentiments of the honorable member for Brisbane. Some honorable
            members have been four months away from Queensland, and others four months away from
            Western Australia, whilst members coming from the other States are able to get to their
            homes every week-end. If honorable members had known that there would be only half a
            day's work this week many of them could have taken a week off from Friday last.
          

##### Mr FISHER:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Treasurer &middot; Wide Bay &middot; ALP</small>

-- In reply to honorable members, I may state that if I had known last week what I
            know  *now*  I should not have been in the position I
            am in to-day. Circumstances over which I had no control have placed me in that position.
            I remind honorablemembers that the sooner a financial statement is made the better, as
