### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-0-0}
#### INTOXICATING LIQUOR

##### Mr W ELLIOT JOHNSON:<br><small class="text-muted">LANG, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- In  view of the action taken by the war authorities of Great Britain and of the allied nations to discourage indulgence in alcoholic beverages, will the Minister for the Navy reconsider the determination to provide such beverages in connexion with the launching of the cruiser  *Brisbane,*  and will he give the instruction that no such beverages shall be made available then? 

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for the Navy &middot; BASS, TASMANIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- It is not my intention to reconsider the decision. 

##### Mr THOMAS:<br><small class="text-muted">BARRIER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- As the Right Honorable Lloyd George, the British Minister for Munitions, has stated that the drink evil is one of the enemies against which the Empire is fighting, will the AttorneyGeneral, if the Minister for the Navy provides intoxicating liquors for consumption at the launching of the  *Brisbane,*  intern him for dealing with the enemy? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Attorney-General &middot; WEST SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- I promised last night that no British-born subject would be interned without the consent of the Cabinet.

### QUESTION

#### SITE FOR MUNITIONS FACTORY

##### Mr ATKINSON:<br><small class="text-muted">WILMOT, TASMANIA</small>

-- Has the Minister representing the Minister of Defence seen in the Tasmanian press articles recommending Beaconsfield , Tasmania, as a site for a munitions factory; and, if so, have steps been taken by the Government to establish a munitions factory there? 

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I have read the letter in the press, but I do not know that steps have been taken by, the Government to avail themselves of the buildings and works at Beaconsfield;

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-2-0}
#### WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES

##### Mr FOWLER:<br><small class="text-muted">PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I have received complaints regarding the filling of positions on the medical staff of the Western Australian Expeditionary Force with doctors from the Eastern States, and have been informed that opportunity was not given to the medical men of Western Australia to fill these positions. Will the Minister for the Navy, in making the inquiry that he promised yesterday regarding a similar complaint concerning the appointment of military officers, endeavour to ascertain whether the statements to which I now draw attention are correct; and, if so, why Western Australian medical men are not being permitted to join the Expeditionary Force of the State? 

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I shall bo glad to comply with the honorable member's request.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-3-0}
#### TELEPHONE CHARGES

##### Mr PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">MARANOA, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- I ask the PostmasterGeneral what is the cause of the delay in putting on the table, for the discussion of the House, the regulation authorizing an increase in the telephone charges ? 

##### Mr SPENCE:<br><small class="text-muted">Postmaster-General &middot; DARLING, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- The regulation has not yet been passed by the Executive. 

##### Mr PAGE:

-- Is it the intention of the honorable gentleman to increase the telephone rates before the House re-assembles in October? 

##### Mr SPENCE:

-- When the regulation comes into force it will apply immediately to new subscribers; but those who have paid rent for their telephones will receive three months' notice of the intention of the Department to increase the rates, and there will be no collection from them at the higher rate until this notice has expired. 

##### Mr GROOM:<br><small class="text-muted">DARLING DOWNS, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Are the new rates to apply only to new subscribers, and will the regulation which authorizes them come into force before the House meets again in October? 

##### Mr SPENCE:

-- I anticipate that the regulation will be published next week. The new rates will at once apply to new subscribers, but existing subscribers will receive three months' notice of the increase in charges, though we are not obliged to give them more than one month's notice. . 

##### Mr ORCHARD:<br><small class="text-muted">NEPEAN, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- As it is intended to increase the telephone rates, and subscribers are very dissatisfied with the present mode of rendering accounts, it being impossible to check them, or to be sure that they are reasonably accurate, will the Postmaster-General say whether the Department is doing anything to introduce a better system of keeping the telephone call accounts? 

##### Mr SPENCE:

-- The Department claims that its systemof recording calls is absolutely accurate, and it is for subscribers to show that it is not. We have tested a great many complaints, and the complainants have always been forced to admit, when the facts were brought before them, that they had made errors.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-4-0}
#### RETURN OF WOUNDED SOLDIERS

Absence of Flags From Parliament House

##### Mr KELLY:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I ask you,  **Mr. Speaker,**  why, although every other public building in Melbourne is decorated with bunting this morning, in honour of the return of sick and wounded soldiers, this building is without flags? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The staff of the building were in attendance until the early hours of the morning, and that perhaps is the reason of the oversight. I understand that our flags are now flying. 

##### Mr Kelly:

--  They were not being flown when the procession was passing through the city.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-5-0}
#### FITZROY DOCKYARD

Provision of Hot Meals

##### Mr MAHONY:<br><small class="text-muted">DALLEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- As mess-rooms in  which workmen can obtain hot meals are provided at most of the British naval dockyards, will the Minister for the Navy take into consideration the desirability of making similar provision on Cockatoo Island ? 

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The honorable gentleman made the suggestion to me a few weeks ago, and, having considered it with the manager of the Fitzroy Dock, I have decided to do what he asks.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-6-0}
#### CANTEENS AT GALLIPOLI

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- In view of the additional information with which I supplied the Minister for the Navy yesterday in regard to canteen arrangements at Gallipoli, can the honorable gentleman tell the House exactly what is being done there?. 

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- There has been no time to look into the matter. The Minister of Defence and myself have been too much occupied.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-7-0}
#### UNEMPLOYED NATURALIZED SUBJECTS

##### Mr GLYNN:<br><small class="text-muted">ANGAS, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I wish to know from the Minister for the Navy what provision is made for the support of the families of naturalized persons of enemy origin "who cannot get work because of the disinclina-  tion of other citizens to work with them, or to give them work ? 

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I am not aware that any provision is being made for their support.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-8-0}
#### MILITARY DEATH CERTIFICATES

##### Mr WISE:<br><small class="text-muted">GIPPSLAND, VICTORIA</small>

-- A day or two ago the Minister for the Navy stated that the Defence Department issues the certificates of death required by life insurance societies in connexion with policy claims, but as such certificates are not issued in respect of soldiers dying in Victoria, will the Government undertake to pay the fee - 10s. 6d. - which is charged by the doctors who give them ? 

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I quite see the justice of the request, and shall bring the matter under the notice of the Minister of Defence, so that effect may be given to it.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-9-0}
#### WAR PRECAUTIONS REGULATIONS

##### Mr GLYNN:

-- The regulations issued under the War Precautions Act - Statutory rules 1915, No. 130 - contain the following provisions: - 3. (2) Nothing in these Regulations shall be construed as affecting the right to trial by a civil court of persons, other than alien enemies or persons subject to the Naval Discipline Act, or to military law, for offences against the Act. 54. (1) Any person authorized for the purpose by the competent naval or military authority, or any police constable, or officer of Customs, may arrest without warrant any person - 

{: type="a" start="a"}
0. whoso behaviour is of such a nature as to give reasonable grounds for suspecting that ho has acted, or is acting, or is about to act, in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the Commonwealth. 

These regulations take away the right of appeal that existed before. Will the AttorneyGeneral look into them and see that the right of appeal when an arrest takes place under section 54 is restored ? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The honorable member has put a question involving a great many matters of fundamental importance, and I am quite unable to deal with them by way of a reply to his question; but I refer the honorable member to a statement I made at the last sitting, to the effect that no British-born subject arrested under the warrant of the Minister can remain interned unless Cabinet so approves. With regard to the question of offences against the Act, I shall see whether there is anything in the regulations which deprives a British-born subject of that right to a. civil trial which was presumed to be safeguarded under regulation 3.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-10-0}
#### CASE OF GUNNER PERRY

##### Mr ANSTEY:<br><small class="text-muted">BOURKE, VICTORIA</small>

-- Has the Minister for the Navy any answer to the statement made in the chamber yesterday by the honorable member for Melbourne? 

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- Yes; but the AttorneyGeneral wishes to make a statement in regard to it. 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I wish to make a statement in regard to the matter. 

Leave given. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I have seen the Minister of Defence, and discussed this case with him. He told me that it was not true that he had given an order at any time to arrest this man Perry, and that it was not true that he had been arrested. The Minister said that the Military Board had considered the case, and Had expressed the opinion that he was not suffering from paralysis, but from hysteria, and they had ordered him into hospital for further treatment. As far as I can gather from what the Minister has told me, it was not contended that the man was not ill. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- Was an armed guard sent to take him to the hospital? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- No. Members of the Army Medical Corps, who are never armed, were sent to convey him to the hospital. According to the Minister, they asked the landlady where Perry was, and she said that he was not at home. Thereupon the Army Medical men went away. That is the statement of the Minister of Defence. I understand that the Minister for the Navy has been furnished with a report by the Department, which perhaps honorable members will permit him to read. 

Leave given. 

##### Mr JENSEN:

-- In compliance with the promise made yesterday, that I would get a statement from the Minister of Defence concerning this case, and make it available to the House, I submit the following report which has been furnished to me: - 

  >Gunner Perry. 
  >
  >
 **Dr. Maloney's** statements summarized con tain the following charges: - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. That after the Minister had promised 


 **Dr. Maloney** that Perry would not be arrested after desertion, an attempt was made to arrest him. 

{: type="1" start="2"}
0. That  **Dr. Maloney**  sent  **Mrs. Perry**  to the Minister, and that she was told that the Minister could not see her. 
1. That the promise made that every soldier invalided home would receive pay, board, and medical attendance had not been kept. 

In regard to (1), when Perry had deserted from the hospital, and was therefore liable to arrest,  **Dr. Maloney,**  on the 14th June, wrote to the Minister, asking that " no arrest be made of this poor injured man for leaving the hospital without leave." On this representation, and after looking over the file, the Minister gave instructions that Perry was not to be arrested; but, as Perry had deserted, and was not arrested, he, therefore, by his own action, became automatically discharged, and pay therefore ceased. 

{: type="1" start="2"}
0. On Friday, the 3rd September, 1915,  **Dr. Maloney**  wrote to the Minister, pointing out that  **Mrs. Perry**  " is getting desperate with her injured husband, and no allowance whatever," and "that it would be a charity if something definite is decided, for if this poor fellow is to get nothing, I must start a public subscription." It may be added that this letter ends with this paragraph - " With all greetings re your plucky act, and good luck." 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- That was in reference to the occasion on which he went up in an aeroplane, which was a plucky act. 

##### Mr JENSEN:

-- Apparently, it was a compliment to the Minister. The departmental report continues - 

  >The Minister at once gave instructions that a Medical Board was to at once assemble, to investigate the case, and report, as soon as possible, what further action should be taken. This was on Monday, the 6th. On the 7th the Board assembled, consisting of - 


 **Colonel (Dr.) Cuscaden, P.M.O., President.** 



 **Major (Dr) Wilkinson,** 



 **Major (Dr.) W. R. Bird,** 


Their report was (7/9/15) - " We cannot find any evidence of definite organic nerve disease in this man. We are of opinion that the whole disability is hysterical, and that he requires, and should have, treatment in a suitable hospital, under medical supervision." 

On the 8th instant an ambulance was sent to bring Perry to hospital. On arrival at his house, the ambulance waited for twenty minutes, and were told by a lady that he was not there. 

The bald facts of the case are that this man broke hospital. He was not arrested, as I had issued definite instructions that this was not to be done. The Board sat on his case, returned a finding that he should have further treatment; an ambulance went to bring him along, and was told he was not there. 

{: type="1" start="3"}
0. When the Minister was informed that  **Mrs. Perry**  wished to see him, he at once saw her, took down a statement of her case, and gave instructions that inquiries were to be made at once what money was due to her, and that any money that was due to her was to be paid. The 

Finance Member reports that all arrears have now been paid. 

By his own action in deserting and his nonarrest at the request of  **Dr. Maloney,**  Perry ceased to have any claim on the Department, as obviously the Department cannot be responsible for a man who has passed beyond its control by his own act. 

It will, therefore, be seen that on the three charges made, the statements made by  **Dr. Maloney**  are not sustained. 

The following is a copy of the statement by the driver of the ambulance: - 


 *Statement by Driver of Ambulance which went for Gunner Perry.* 


As instructed, with Driver Byers, I went to the house of Gunner Perry, in Walsh-street, West Melbourne, on the evening of the 8th inst., to convey patient to the Base Hospital.. On inquiry at the house for Gunner Perry, the lady who answered said she would see. After waiting some time, about half -an -hour, she returned to the door, said he was not in, and that he may have gone to a friend's place at St. Kilda. I asked for the friend's address, and she said she had no idea where it was. I went to the nearest station, and rang up the hospital for further instructions, and was instructed to come back. There were only the two of us on the ambulance. We were unarmed. (Sd.)  Alfred Edward Skinner,  10th September, 1915. 

Secretary for Defence. 

Herewith statement of Driver Alfred Edward Skinner, ambulance,  *re*  call to take Gunner Perry to Base Hospital. (Sd)  R.  E.  Williams,  Colonel, 

A/Comraandant, 3rd M.D.

#### POSTAL DEPARTMENT

##### Mr SINCLAIR:<br><small class="text-muted">MORETON, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Can the PostmasterGeneral say whether any settlement has been arrived at between the Postal Department and the Sorters Union with regard to the efficiency barrier test? 

##### Mr SPENCE:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- We have had no communication from the executive of the union in reply to letters sent to them; and I have not heard of any dissatisfaction having been expressed. 

##### Mr MANIFOLD:<br><small class="text-muted">CORANGAMITE, VICTORIA</small>

-- Owing to the great disorganization of country mail services in Victoria through the reduction of passenger trains, will the Postal Department arrange for the continuance of a daily service to the principal country towns, where they have had them for years past, whether the mails have to be carried by trolleys or by road vehicles, or on horseback ? I do not think that expense should be considered in this matter. 

##### Mr SPENCE:

-- The Department is doing its best to arrange with the railway authorities to carry mails where goods trains run daily, or where the people are agreeable to get their mails by trolley service. Though the passenger train service is reduced, the Post Office still has to pay the same for the carriage of the mails, and it is only fair that where goods trains are run the Railway Department should carry mails on them. I do not think that it is a reasonable request that the Postal Department should be asked to run a vehicular service alongside a railway line. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA</small>

-- Do the State Railway Departments make a proportionate reduction in their charges to the Postal Department when the train service is curtailed ? 

##### Mr SPENCE:

-- No reduction of charges is made. The Postal Department has to pay the Railway Department the same amount if a train runs only once a week instead of daily. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- Does the arrangement with the various Railway Departments provide for a schedule specifying the services to be rendered on each line, or is a lump sum paid by the Postal Department? Can no reduction be made where the train service is being curtailed, in some cases over 50 per cent. ? 

##### Mr SPENCE:

-- There is no reduction. The arrangement is altogether one-sided, and against the Postal Department. The railway authorities carry parcels at much lower rates than those charged to the Department. They carry newspaper parcels for1s. per hundredweight, irrespective of distance, but they charge the Postal Department per mile. In New South Wales newspaper parcels are carried by the Railway Department at half pre-paid parcel rates, and, if carried at owner's risk, at a quarter of those rates. The agreement is most unreasonable, and it must be altered next year. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- Will the Minister open up negotiations with the State Go vernments with a view to the substitution of a motor service, or some other form of transport, in order that the mail contract may be carried out in districts where the train service has been reduced. 

##### Mr SPENCE:

-- We have been in communication with the State Governments, and the Premier of Queensland has agreed to assist the Postal Department. With regard to the others we must abide by the legal agreements with the Railway Commissioners until they can be terminated. 

##### Mr PALMER:<br><small class="text-muted">ECHUCA, VICTORIA</small>

-- Does the contract with the Railway Department contain any provision for cancellation ? If so, what is the earliest date at which the agreement can be terminated ? 

##### Mr SPENCE:

-- Twelve months' notice is required.

The relatives received private advice of his death, and three times they asked the Department for particulars. They were assured that he was alive, but, eventually, four mouths after his death, they received notification from the Department that Private Barnes had been killed on the day of the landing at Gallipoli, 25th April? 

##### Mr JENSEN:

-- I will have inquiry made. 

##### Mr JOHN THOMSON:<br><small class="text-muted">COWPER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

I suggested that the honorable member for Maranoa should be appointed from the Government side, and another member from the Opposition side. Has that suggestion been considered ? 

##### Mr JENSEN:

-- The suggestion has received consideration, and I believe that the Minister of Defence is about to announce the appointment of some persons to constitute such a Committee.

-- I desire to ask the AttorneyGeneral whether he will cause to be set out in the list which is being circulated at post-offices to prevent the carriage of newspapers advertising enemy goods, not only the names of the firms which are tabulated, but also the goods themselves, which are obviously of the most importance. If this be not done, the firms will change their names, and the goods will still be advertised. I wish, further, to ask whether in this list the AttorneyGeneral will include the goods of enemy origin and enemy benefit operated in Sydney by Messrs. George Arnold and Company, and Messrs. J. Blau and Company ? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The scope of this embargo is necessarily limited. It has relation to those articles which depend for their sale upon extensive advertising. It cannot be effective in regard to drugs, which do not depend upon advertising for their sale. Sanatogen, to take a striking case, depends almost entirely upon advertising. I say nothing of its virtues, for I know nothing of them. If we prevent the advertising of such an article, we, in effect, prevent its sale. I do not know that I can extend the list to the goods operated by Messrs George Arnold and Company. I do not know them. I think that Messrs. J. Blau and Company advertise a preparation called Laxatine. It is proposed to add that to the list, as it falls into the same class. They do not advertise "4711," so that it could not be included. It relates to a question of importation, which is in a quite different  class. If the honorable member will supply me with a list of the preparations sold by George Arnold and Company, I will see that if they are of this particular class they are added to the list.

Provided that payment of separation allowance shall in no case be made beyond an amount which, together with the member's pay (including after embarkation, deferred pay) will exceed 8s. per diem. 

The rate of pay of a private of the Infantry of the Line in the Imperial Army is1s. per diem, but other arms vary slightly. 

The rates of separation allowance payable to a private in the Imperial Army are - 

For wife only, 9s. per week. 

For wife and one child, 14s. per week. 

For wife and two children, 17s. 6d. per week. 

For each additional child, 2s. per week. 

{: type="1" start="2"}

The Commonwealth Government pays on account of reservists returning to the colours, other than commissioned officers, the difference between the British Army rates of their rank and the Australian Imperial Force rate of pay of a similar rank, and the difference between Imperial and Australian rates of separation allowance. Such difference of pay and separation allowance, however, is paid, not to reservists personally, but to -

1. Will the Minister consider the necessity of refusing to issue such permits in future? 

##### Mr JENSEN:

-- The answers to the honorable member's questions are - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. No information has been received of any such occurrence. Inquiry will be made. 
1. Permits are only issued after stringent inquiry, and are withdrawn if there is any ground for suspicion. It is not thought that an absolute prohibition of all naturalized subjects of enemy origin would be justified.

##### Mr JENSEN:

-- No. He is employed as a military officer, and the principle of preference is not applied in such appointments.

In view of the extraordinary precautions taken when one suspicious case of small-pox was discovered in Melbourne during the epidemic in Sydney when barriers were put up that practically isolated Sydney, and in view of the fact that the mortality of that smallpox epidemic was under 1 per cent., whereas with the best results we can hope for in cerebro-spinal meningitis 60 per cent, of deaths occur, what does the Government intend to do in the way of quarantine or other precautions to prevent the spread of a disease which is recognized by the highest authorities as the most terrible and deadly disease of modern civilization?

#### NEWSPAPER CENSORSHIP

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- Recently the honorable member for Wentworth asked me the following question: - 

  >Will the Minister for the Navy have inquiries made into the statement appearing in the  *Argus*  this morning in regard to news matter not directly referring to the war that the censor on three occasions forbade publication of news in the  *Argus*  which was allowed to appear in the  *Age?*  Will the Minister inform the House to-morrow whether that statement is a fact? 

I promised to have inquiries made, and have received the following official statement :  - 

  >In connexion with a statement appearing in the  *Argus*  that on three occasions matter not referring directly to the war was forbidden to the  *Argus*  and allowed to appear in the  *Age;*  so far as the censoris concerned, there can be no differentiation as to the press, nor any motive for it. Extreme care is taken to give all papers identical directions, issued at the same time, and any release by the censorship is conveyed to all. 
  >
  >Previous to the honorable member's question, the matter had received attention, and the following are the facts in regard to the three cases to which it is presumed reference is made: - 
  >
  >The censor, by direction of the Honorable the Minister, notified papers that the Prime Minister requested no reference be made to the arrangements for bringing the body of a distinguished officer to Australia until arrangements were officially released. The  *Argus*  scrupulously respected the request. The  *Age*  on the 2lst ult., without referring to the censor, published a notice of the funeral arrangements. The paper was called upon' for an explanation. The explanation given is considered to be satisfactory, as it did not disclose the so-called official source of the information. 
  >
  >The  *Age*  on 27th ult. published, without submission to the censor, a description of the armament, &amp;c., of the  *Torrens.*  The censor asked their authority for publishing such particulars without reference. The paper, in its explanation, said the information had been obtained from a source which would be regarded by the censorship as official. No notice was given to the Censor's Department of any official release, and it is against the rules of the censorship to disclose such matter unless sanctioned by proper official sources. 
  >
  >The  *Argus*  refrained from publishing particulars of the armament, &amp;c. 
  >
  >Further inquiry is still pending as to the source of the release claimed by the  *Age,*  such release not having come from the censor. 
  >
  >On the subject of the statement made as to changes in  *personnel*  in Medical Unit in Egypt, the matter was withheld by direction, but was mentioned in Parliament, and no objection would have been made to reports of any statement in the matter in Parliament, as parliamentary reports are not subject to censorship, except in the rare cases in which the Federal Government have given specific orders.

1. Is the Minister aware that all these men were recommended by the Chief Inspector for Shell as qualified and competent to carry out the duties of inspectors of shell? 
2. Is it a fact that the responsible officer recommended that these men's services could be spared to go with the siege battery in a junior capacity to men whom they had trained ? 
3. If so, will the Minister ascertain what circumstance now exists which justifies the refusal to grant these men the preference conferred on them by the Defence Act, Part VI., section 63, sub-section 3? 

##### Mr JENSEN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

#### PAPER

  >Panama Pacific Exposition, San Francisco - Correspondence between the Minister for Public Works, Victoria, and the Minister for External Affairs, in connexion with Australian representation at. 

Ordered to be printed. 

ADJOURNMENT  *(Formal).*  Case of Gunner Perry. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I have received a letter from the honorable member for Melbourne, intimating that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, cases pertaining to the Base Hospitals and the Camps." 


 *Five honorable members having risen in their places,* 


Question proposed. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

.- The Minister of Defence seems to have been struck very forcibly by the statement that I " admired his pluck," which I made in my letter to him regarding the Perry case. My reference was to his plucky flight in an aeroplane, and if it has given offence to him, I can only say that he must be under a misapprehension. I think I can make out a clear case against  **Senator Pearce**  in regard to Gunner Perry. I was definitely promised that Perry would not be compelled to return to the Base Hospital. I did not ask for his discharge as a soldier. Can it be imagined that, had I done so, I would have repeatedly made both written and personal requests to the Minister for monetary assistance for him and his poor wife? 

##### Mr Kelly:

-- In any case, if he was discharged, why did the authorities send for him ? 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- That is a point that I was about to mention. Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, the Minister for the Navy in this House said, in reply to a question that I put, that Perry was being taken back to go before a Medical Board. 

The inaccuracy of that statement is shown by the answer supplied by the Minister of Defence himself, in which it is stated that the Board visited the man the night before the ambulance was sent for him. This then can be only an after-thought. I think honorable members will agree with me that the intention was to drag back the man to the Base Hospital. I repeat that accusation, and say that the promise made to me was broken, not by the special order of the Minister, but by officials under him. 

##### Mr Mathews:

-- Did Perry and his wife desire that he should continue to draw his pay? 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- Yes. 

##### Mr Mathews:

-- Then it was absolutely necessary that he should go before the doctor. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- He went before a doctor, and was tortured and tormented by him. Where is that doctor now? Is he still in the Base Hospital ? Coming now to the report that has been furnished, I desire to say that  Colonel  Cuscaden  is a personal friend of mine, and that I have a great admiration for . him. If I were a woman about to become a mother he is one of the first medical men whom I would call in. As a matter of fact, he is a woman's doctor. Neither Colonel Fetherston nor Colonel  Cusca'den  have had that experience which alone should entitle a medical man to be at the head of our Army Medical Corps. A proposal to appoint a gynaecologist - a medical man skilled only in the treatment of the diseases of women - to the head of the Army Medical Corps in England would be scoffed at. Why was this medical man appointed to such a position here? Why should not the Department have availed itself of the services of some_of the highest consulting surgeons to the Melbourne and Alfred Hospitals, the two great operating hospitals in Victoria ? According to a parliamentary book before me, among the consulting surgeons at the Melbourne Hospital are  **Dr. W.**  Moore,  Colonel Ryan,  and  **Dr. Stirling. Colonel Ryan**  is at the front ready and willing to fight ;  **Dr. Moore**  is here, and  **Dr. Stirling**  is in Melbourne, and is possibly the greatest surgeon on the Melbourne Hospital Staff at the present time. Then, again, among the surgeons attending in-patients are  **Dr. Fred.**  Bird, who is also away at the front, and is one of the four greatest surgeons practising in Victoria. I have nothing to say against  **Major Wilkinson,**  but I do not find his name in this list, nor do I find the nam© of  **Major W.**  R. Bird.  Colonel Cuscaden's  name is on the list of consulting surgeons, but he is a woman's doctor. For the first time in the history of any country, women doctors have been appointed to the head of the Army Medical Forces. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- I rise to a point of order, which I take in the interests of the honorable member who is speaking. Under the Standing Orders, if a motion shall not have been disposed of two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate thereon must be interrupted, unless the House otherwise orders. It is now nearly 1 p.m., and I should like this question to be settled now, so that we may know exactly whether the honorable member will be permitted to continue when we resume at 2.15. No one desires, I am sure, to limit the honorable member in his speech to-day. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the House did not meet until 12 noon to-day, so that there will be ample time for me to consider the question raised by him. 


 *Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.* 


##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I desire to refer to the point of order raised a little while ago. This is a very exceptional case, such as has not come within my experience hitherto, nor, I think, within the experience of any other honorable member. One hour and a quarter has intervened, and, under the circumstances, I shall allow the debate to proceed for the usual time namely, until a quarter past three o'clock. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- I do not wish to unduly labour the matter. The great point of difference between the Minister of Defence and myself is in regard to the promise that was made to me. I do not accuse the honorable gentleman of having caused the promise to be broken, but, owing to the action of his officials, it was not kept, as I think I shall clearly prove. When I learned of the torture that this man had undergone, and that medical men of repute in this city - one of them an exceptionally good surgeon - had declared that this man was not malingering, I took up the matter purely in my representative capacity as a member of Parliament, and at the request of certain of my constituents. Then I wrote to the Department and asked that this man should not be forced back to where he had been tortured. 

##### Mr McGrath:

-- You did not ask for his discharge ? 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- No ; absolutely no. 

##### Mr McGrath:

-- And the Department took advantage of the circumstances to discharge him. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- I believe that, technically, when a man deserts his pay stops from that time ; but surely one who is injured, and is being tortured, does not lose all the rights of a human being? If medical men of repute are willing to attend him, with or without fee, surely he should not lose those rights which the people are willing he should enjoy ! 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- Surely it is within the power of the authorities to give him leave of absence. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- The court-martial that was held gave a verdict in the man's favour; and that fact is not denied by the Minister. On Monday night two doctors, at least, attended the man, and remained with him for a considerable period; and when I went the following day he was again carefully examined - and I supervised the examination myself - by one of the most competent surgeons in Melbourne, who declared that undoubtedly it was not a case of malingering. The wife, shrewd woman as she was, said that previously there had not been applied what are really important tests in cases of this kind. I was astonished to learn from the discussion at the Trades Hall Council, that an armed guard of three had attended at the man's home; and it is quite possible that any man outside the military would regard three men in uniform as a guard. 

##### Mr Hannan:

-- I think an average intelligent man can distinguish between Red Cross soldiers and an armed guard. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- At eleven o'clock at* night ? The statement was made that these men in uniform were sent to take this man before the Board, but we know that the Board had met the night before, so that explanation must fall to the ground. The real object was to take him back to the hospital, in spite of the promise that had been given to me. 

##### Mr Riley:

-- Was it not at the request of the wife that it was sought to take him back to the hospital ? 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- On the contrary, that has all along been the fear and dread of the wife. A great point has been made of the fact that the man was away when the uniformed men called, but that was ewing to the cleverness of the wife, who hid him when she saw the uniforms. The next day I had the man removed to a certain place until I could bring the matter before the House. In this, perhaps, ]  broke  the law, but I would do the same again and again under the circumstances. I did not know that representatives of the great Labour organization of Victoria had seen this man; but we may take it that, with their experience of persons trying to obtain trade union funds, they have some knowledge of what is and what is not malingering. This man has been a splendid footballer, he fought in South Africa, and has been to China, and I ask whether he is the sort of person to malinger when he could get work? 

##### Mr Orchard:

-- It is not said by the Department that he was malingering.  

##### Mr Groom:

-- It is said that he is suffering from hysteria. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- A woman's doctor is always apt to diagnose a case as one of hysteria. A tender spot in the spine is well defined, and the reflexes are exaggerated in a way that no mere malingerer could reproduce. This case should be investigated by an independent body consisting of the very highest surgeons in Melbourne, who have offered their services without fee or reward. I do not wish to wrong the Minister, and I cannot admit that he did not say I had asked for this man's discharge. I ask, however, why they should seek to take him back to the hospital if he discharged himself by his own act ? I have obtained the solemn promise, through the lips of  **Senator Russell,**  that this man will not be forced back to the hospital, and I know the promise will be kept; and on that I have had the man taken back to Iris home. I have been waited on by members of a ladies' organization, who informed me that these people are likely to be turned out to-morrow for the non-payment of rent. Attention is being given to this matter, and I wish honorable members to remember the refusal of this poor woman of any more pecuniary assistance from me. If something is not done for this family I shall appeal to the great-hearted public, to the trade unions and others and suggest that a committee be appointed to investigate the case. If I could only bring this man into the chamber, I am sure there is. not an honorable member who would say there was any sign of malingering. 

##### Mr McGrath:

-- Do you not desire to have an inquiry into the conduct of the doctor who is alleged to have tortured this man? 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- What has to be decided is whether this man is  *or*  is not malingering. 

##### Mr Groom:

-- Was not the decision of the court martial in his favour? 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- The court martial, with Captain Cox Taylor in the chair, decided that he was not malingering. I am told that  **Dr. Meade**  has been removed from the hospital, and perhaps the most serious charge made against him last night was that he had forced this unfortunate wife to give up the certificates that her husband brought from Egypt. If that be so, the Minister should compel the doctor to produce the documents. It is a great pity that the Minister of Defence has not a seat in this House, for, if he had, it would be better for all concerned. I ask again why they should seek to take this man back, if he was discharged by his own a:ct? Why should I ask for money if I thought this man had been discharged from the Army ? Why should I appeal for assistance for these helpless people? Does a man lose all his rights, human and civil, when he joins the Forces? Let an independent Board make the necessary investigation, and not Army officers. Let the matter be left to surgeons from the greatest institutions in Melbourne - say the Melbourne Hospital and the Alfred Hospital - who, I understand, have offered their services free to the Department. I say, without fear of contradiction, that in no other country in the world are women doctors permitted to have control of such matters. It is not proposed, I suppose, to have maternity hospitals or other hospitals for diseases of women at the front? 

##### Mr McGrath:

-- Is it not a fact that a doctor. for such Army appointments, has to be a captain or a colonel, without much regard to his medical ability? 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- What we require are surgeons who understand how to treat deadly wounds. 

##### Mr McGrath:

-- Take the case of  **Dr. Carty**  Salmon. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>


 **- Dr. Carty** Salmon has been appointed to an administrative position, and I know he is not one to say that he could operate in any way comparable to that of the well-known surgeons of our great hospitals. At present the honorary consulting surgeons at the Alfred Hospital are  **Dr. Cooke**  and  **Dr. O'Hara,**  and at the Melbourne Hospital,  **Dr. Moore, Colonel C.**  S. Ryan, and  **Dr. Stirling. Dr. Ryan**  is away at the front, but the others have, I understand, volunteered their services. I want now to speak on the subject of meningitis. According to this morning's newspapers  **Dr.**  Cuscaden  has said that the situation gives no cause for alarm, that the military police have been isolated, merely as a precautionary measure, and that it was not expected that fresh cases would occur amongst the men quartered in Moorestreet. The death rate amongst sufferers from this terrible disease is 80 per cent, where no serum is available. With the  Flexner  serum the death rate is brought down to 40 per cent., and the greatest American authority on the subject has stated that rarely does a recovery take place in a sufferer under two years of age. During the small-pox scare, when a supposed case occurred in Melbourne, Sydney was isolated. I speak under correction, but I think nobody actually died from the small-pox, and the chance of infection was considerably less than in the case of meningitis. I have been informed of one man who, after kissing his child in the evening, died in raving agony from meningitis, about 4 o'clock next day. That sort of thing does not occur with small-pox. Meningitis is 600 times more deadly, and I would ask what is being done in regard to it. If any one belonging to me were about to bring a little Australian into the world, I would have the greatest faith in the ability of  **Dr.**  Cuscaden.  In that branch of medical science I do not think I can speak too highly of  **Dr.**  Cuscaden;  but in regard to a matter of this kind, where meningitis is concerned, he is absolutely out of it. Reverting to the case of Gunner Perry, I want to ask the head of the Government, or the Minister acting in his place, to appoint a Committee that will be uninfluenced by military considerations, un affected by what has been said, or by the fear of injuring any one in the medical profession, to deal with it. Let that Committee decide whether this man is a malingerer or not. If he is not, then let his wife and family have. some of the money that the people of Australia are pouring out so lavishly. If that is done my object will have been achieved. I understand that men eminent in the medical profession have offered their services free. They could settle the matter in an hour. I want to prevent this sort of thing occurring in the future at any- hospital, whether it is a Base Hospital or a hospital at any one of the various camps. I want now to refer to the appointment of Colonel Kirkland to the command of the Liverpool Camp. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member's time has expired. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

.- I desire to put it to the Minister, and to honorable members, in connexion with  the  case of Gunner Perry, particularly if his is a hysterical case, as has been suggested, that if he had been dealt with, sympathetically, he would have been given leave of absence, and allowed to mix amongst his own people. That would have done him more good than anything else. 

##### Mr KING O'MALLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">DARWIN, TASMANIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- That would have looked like business. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- I do not know whether it would or not, but it appears to me that that would have been a common-sense, way of dealing with a case like this. If the man's peculiar hysteria was that he was being tortured, the simplest way of dealing with him would have been to have permitted him to mix freely with his own people. If it is not a hysterical case, as the honorable member for Melbourne still maintains, but one of paralysis caused by injury to the spine, the man would have recovered much more quickly by being allowed to remain amongst his own people than in any other way. But the point I want to put before the Minister - and I want to put it before him very earnestly - is that, the time has now come when the Government should consider the basic organization of all the big military hospitals. At ' the outbreak of the war there were connected with the Military Department a number of medical officers carrying various titles, from General downwards, who had been attached to the Military Forces for a considerable time.: They had served in the various camps, and had gone through a course of training that fitted them for the military service required in the field. The medical organization, so far as it is concerned with field operations, should be conducted more or less strictly on military lines; but where base hospitals are concerned - where there "are a large number of wounded men who will be patients for a more or less protracted period - the basis of the organization no longer requires to be military in character. While I admit the necessity of putting a military officer into these hospitals to deal with the purely military side, I do not think it is essential that the officer should be a medical man. The same basis of organization is required at the base hospitals as at the great civil hospitals scattered throughout the country. If we were to put the Melbourne or the Sydney Hospital, or any other big hospital, under the control of, military officers, calling them Generals and Colonels and so on, everybody would think we had lost our senses, and similarly in the base hospitals, where the medical and nursing sides are of the most importance, military organization is not necessary. We have had from the medical men of this country a most generous offer to come to the assistance of the Government. The gentlemen who have made that offer do not require that they should be called Colonels or Captains. What they desire to do is to give the best services they can to their country in the interests of the men who have done so well by the country. 

##### Mr McGrath:

-- But you cannot get that class of man appointed. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- The whole trouble has been that these hospitals have been organized, first and last, purely on a military basis. In all military concerns control goes by seniority in the ranks. Honorable members may look through the lists of the Army Medical Corps in Australia, and they will find in them scarcely any of the country's prominent surgeons and doctors, with one or two very notable exceptions. The explanation is that these medical gentlemen have been unable to give their services to the country in the way Chey would have liked, on account of the calls of their private practices. The result is there are medical gentlemen in the Army Service Corps senior to men who, from the purely professional point of view, would take the higher rank. In connexion with most hospitals s&gt; small paid staff is engaged, but the principal work is done by honorary medical men who are perfectly willing to do the same class of work at the base hospitals, and I suggest to the Government that that point should be very closely investigated by the War Committee, in order to discoverwhether it is ' not possible to reorganize the whole of the Army Service Corps on such lines as I have suggested. While I am dealing with this point, may I also refer to the position of the nursing staff. Before the outbreak of the war there were in Australia a number of ladies who had already joined the Army Nursing Service Corps. There was a principal matron, I understand, in each of the States. These matrons were ladies who had been very highly trained in the large hospitals of the country, and who had occupied positions of high responsibility. In hospital organization, and in making nursing arrangements generally, their opinions would have been of great value; but they were not called into consultation with the Army Medical Corps at all. That was unfortunate. I do not wish to say anything against the management and control of the Base Hospital in Melbourne, but even there there is room for improvement. Things have transpired which I do not wish to mention this afternoon, those in control not having had the necessary experience. The direction of a large hospital requires a highly trained brain and great practical experience, and the requisite knowledge cannot be obtained in a day. The Government have in their service ladies who are eminently capable of advising and assisting them. A few days ago they called these ladies to Melbourne to a conference, but I am informed, on very good authority, that the Principal Medical Officer contented himself with lecturing them on what he had done, and how he had organised the hospital, and then sent them home again. He did not ask them for their advice, although they had been brought from all over Australia. I hope that the statements that have been made here will be submitted for the investigation of the War Committee, and that the Committee will make it its business to ascertain whether the base hospitals are organized  on  righ't lines. I trust that the persons called in evidence will not be the military authorities, but persons who have had to do with the organization of large hospitals, and able to say what can best be done. 

##### Mr ANSTEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

.- The statements of the honorable member for Melbourne regarding the treatment at the Base Hospital of a soldier named Perry, by  **Dr. Meade,**  should be fully investigated, and, if not substantiated, should be apologized for. When the Rabaul trouble was under discussion, Perry wrote to me from the Base Hospital, protesting against his treatment by  **Dr. Meade,**  and asked me to intervene; but I replied that my hands were too full, and advised him to apply to some one else. Although I did not move in the matter, I saw Perry, and found him to be in a miserable condition; a complete  wreck. He walked with a stick, he could hardly speak, and was trembling and paralytic, and, although a young man, seemed seventy or eighty years of age. To say that he is not an absolute wreck would be untrue. He cannot stand erect, and he cannot speak properly. The case is a pitiable one. The authorities said that Perry was a malingerer; but when I wrote to  **Dr. Meade**  asking for a direct statement from him of the way in which he viewed the case, he merely replied that he had no answer to make, the matter having been dealt with. Perry would not stop in the hospital, and escaped from it. He said that he would rather drown himself than remain there subject to the treatment that he was experiencing and under the suspicion of malingering. What the Minister must ascertain is whether he has been badly treated. The case has not been properly investigated. Why should Perry be sent for at 11 o'clock at night merely to be submitted to an examination? When his complaints were first made, they should have been inquired into, and if he were merely slandering  **Dr. Meade,**  he should have been punished. The average common soldier cannot get justice from the Defence Department. There are officers who have proved themselves to be heroes, but there are many who have been merely shoved into their jobs. Why has not  **Dr. Maloney**  received a military appointment? Jobs have been found for  **Dr. Carty**  Salmon, for  **Mr. Chataway,**  and for Grace Watson. You have only to be connected with the Opposition to get anything you want; but on this side you have no chance of anything. Personally, I would rather grease the fat pig for my friends than for my enemies. Recently, at one of the camps, they have been dosing the men with quinine. This medicine suits some persons and not others ; and some of those to whom it was administered had the skin taken off their arms and legs. When they went to see the doctor, they were kept waiting from early morning until late at night. One of these men had to be bandaged up, and could not dress or feed himself, but he was ordered to report for duty; and when he found it necessary to go to bed for a week, his pay was stopped. That is an instance of the kind of treatment to which the men are subjected. The Minister cannot inquire personally into every case, but there should be a committee to investigate complaints. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">Parramatta</small>

-- I wish to know what is to be the result of this discussion? Is anything to be done? My suggestion is that one of the three Ministers who are administering the Defence Department should, by seeing Perry, settle the questions that have been raised. That would take much less time than is now being wasted upon the case in office procedure and red tape. The Minister must accept responsibility; and if Perry were personally visited by the Minister of Defence or one of his colleagues, or brought to them, the honorable gentleman would see and judge for himself. 

Question resolved in the negative.

### FREIGHT ARRANGEMENTS BILL

{:#subdebate-34-0}
#### Second Reading

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; West Sydney &middot; ALP</small>

-- I move - 

  >That this Bill be now read a second time. 

This is a measure to enable the Treasurer to borrow £100,000 from the Commonwealth Bank, to be paid in respect of an arrangement regarding freights on Australian produce. Honorable members will best serve the purpose they have in view if they set forth any difficulties they find or objections they have, and I shall endeavour to answer them rather than traverse the matter at first. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- Is there any objection to laying the agreement on the table of the House? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I have already read the agreement. The letter from the charterers, which is embodied in  *Hansard,*  is the only agreement that we have. 

##### Mr Joseph Cook:

-- What about the arrangement with the States? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-I am glad the honorable member has reminded me of that. I will ask the Minister of Agriculture of Victoria, who had control of the matter at the Conference at which the agreement was arrived at, and who has sent a copy of the proceedings to all the other States, to furnish me with a copy this afternoon, which I shall lay on the table of the House. 

##### Mr Groom:

-- Does the honorable member propose to ask the House to pass a formal motion approving of the agreement ? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- No, I propose to ask the House to express its opinion on the Bill, though actually it has nothing to do with the agreement itself. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

.- Had the Attorney-General assured the House that this transaction in regard to the export of wheat was a matter which had been undertaken because of the necessities of the war, very little real objection could be taken to the dislocation of trade that has already followed from the agreement that has been entered into, but at no stage has he done so. There may have been need for the Government to be assured that a sufficient quantity of sugar would be imported to make up the deficiency in our sugar crop, but the position in regard to wheat is quite different'. The Attorney-General has not said that it was necessary, in order to provide money for the conduct of the war, that the Commonwealth should undertake the. control of the export of wheat, so that we can regard this Bill as being outside the category of war measures. Even before any chartering of vessels had been done, dislocation of the ordinary channels of trade commenced. 

##### Mr Mahon:

-- Does the honorable member refer to the elimination of middlemen ? 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- No. The honorable member for Grey has clearly proved that, instead of this action on the part of the Commonwealth doing away with middlemen, it will create super-middlemen. By the wording of the agreement itself the agents of the Government' may charter through other persons, and they are to be paid a super-commission over and above the brokerage to be paid to other agents. All through this matter I have objected to the fact that the AttorneyGeneral has not taken the House into bis confidence.  Even to-day we are not given any information. It was only by tracking the Minister from post to post that we could get any from him. He met us in a will o' the wisp fashion, changing his ground so often that we did not know where we stood in the matter, and the position is that to-day we are asked to pass legislation confirming &amp; an arrangement about which we know nothing. In any case, the AttorneyGeneral has entered upon a trading matter about which he could know very little. I do not propose to traverse the qualifications of the two agents whom he has selected. 

##### Mr Poynton:

-- Do they know anything about the business? 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- I think so,  but  there are others who know more about it - Gibbs, Bright, and Company are not wheat brokers. 

##### Mr Poynton:

-- Hear, hear! 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- As wheat brokers they are unknown on the Baltic Exchange. They may have served the Commonwealth in other respects, but why they were selected to act in this matter I do not know. Discussion has already done a considerable amount of good. On the first occasion on which the AttorneyGeneral furnished the House with any details of the commission which is to be paid to the charterers, fie failed to properly interpret what is known as the address commission in the charter party - a survival of an almost obsolete custom by which the shipper of wheat is allowed a rebate of 5 per cent, on the estimated gross freight on the vessel being loaded. The ordinary system is to divide that commission between the charter broker, who usually gets lj per cent., and the shipper, who gets the balance of 3 per cent. At first the Attorney-General said that the brokers' share - 1^ per cent. - would not be disturbed, but when honorable members on this side of the House pointed out that though it might be fair for the brokers to retain 1-J per cent, when freights were normal, and only one vessel was being chartered, it was altogether too high a proportion to allow them when the whole of the chartering was to be in their hands, and when freights are almost double the normal rates. The result of the intervention of honorable members has been to reduce the allowance to the charterers from approximately £75,000 or £80,000 to £25,000. I hope that the House will realize that the action of honorable members on this side has meant a saving of at least £50,000 to the wheat-growers of Australia. 

##### Mr Poynton:

-- The honorable member must not forget that I had something to say in that matter. It was not confined to his side of the House. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- That is so. The honorable member, from his knowledge of the wheat business, was able to point out that the Government were making a present of an unusually large commission to the super-middlemen, as he called them. The Attorney-General finds his first difficulty in regard to the 3' per cent. In the ordinary course of events this 3 per cent, forms portion of the basis upon which the wheat shipper, who almost invariably is also a wheat buyer in Australia, fixes the price he pays to the farmer. It is his ability to buy freight cheaper than his competitors that enables him to pay higher prices than his competitors can do. But the AttorneyGeneral, in answer to the question put- by the honorable member for Wakefield as to what the Government proposed to do with this 3 per cent, that usually goes to the shipper, said that the Government proposed to stick to it. It was immediately pointed out by honorable members that neither the Commonwealth nor the States, the partners of the Commonwealth in this matter, rendered any service to the farmers such as would entitle them to make a levy of 3f per cent, on the wheat exported. In fact, "it was very aptly termed a duty on wheat export. As we are likely to have an exportation of over 2,000,000 tons of wheat this year, the 3£ per cent, should represent £350,000 which would have been retained from the farmers. 

##### Mr Tudor:

-- On what is the honorable member basing his estimates? 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- On a freight of 80s. per ton and an export of 2,000,000 tons of wheat with a brokerage of 4d. per ton deducted from the 5 per cent, commission. The Minister will see that I am well within the mark. The Attorney-General, in reply to the remarks of honorable members, said that this was money that had previously gone into the pockets of the shippers, but he has since then abandoned that position. Subsequently he proposed to divide the 3 per cent, between the States and the Commonwealth, but he now says that after defraying any expenses that may be involved in the administration of this matter, the money will be handed over to the States. It seems to me that the States are to accept all the responsibility and odium that may come about as the result of this arrangement. 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- Will not the States be able to hand the money back in any way they like? 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- I am glad the honorable member has asked that question. When wheat has been bought by the shipper it is put into great heaps. Some of it is sold to the millers, and is gristed here, but the bulk of it is shipped. However, the wheat, so far as the farmer is concerned, has altogether lost its identity. All of it has gone into a big heap, and how can the Government know which farmer's wheat has been shipped and which gristed ? The matter has gone too far for anything like an equitable return to be made. 

##### Mr Sharpe:

-- Will it not be averaged? 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- How can they average it? It is impossible to restore the  *status quo.* 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- Not at all. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- The AttorneyGeneral has found it impossible, and- has asked the States to take over the business, and find a way out of the difficulty. 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- The States are in a different position. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- I have never been able to understand why the States were brought into this business, at all. They own no- wheat; they ship no wheat; and they have no responsibility. I have made it my business to see that before a ratification was made the farmers and shippers obtained certain guarantees from the Commonwealth and the States - firstly, that the Commonwealth would not limit exports, and, secondly, that the States  would not withhold the use of their railway systems, or their country railway stations, or their ports, and that they would not fix prices. The whole business seems likely to get out of order. Before  one ton of freight has been secured from the other side of the world, dislocation is taking place. Ordinarily wheat chartering commences in the month of August, 8 per cent, or 10 per cent, of the freight for the coming harvest being speck chartered, and, as a result, forward sales took place as early as September. To-day a certain proportion of the shipping of the world is getting out of position and away from the Australian trade. Yet, notwithstand- ing that this arrangement was made on the 24th July, not one ton of freight has been secured for the forthcoming harvest. As the harvest is to be a big one, a commencement in securing freights, should have been made at once. When the Prime Minister was asked why the House had not been given an opportunity to discuss this arrangement before it was made, he replied that the matter was urgent. So urgent has it been considered that a day or two ago there had not been a ton of freight chartered under this arrangement. Where, then, was the urgency? Had this business been left to those who usually obtain the freights, a big proportion would have been already secured. The Commonwealth wishes to secure and guarantee freight, but I am .unable to trace in the arrangement with Elder, Smith, and Company and Gibbs, Bright, and Company any undertaking to secure freight or anything as to the price to be paid. The AttorneyGeneral has certainly failed to put the House in possession of reasonable information which would enable me, as a country representative, to say to. the producers that I believed that an arrangement had been made which would best serve the interests of the country. But all we can say now is little better than evidence given at a  *post-mortem*  examination. The bargain has been made, but the country is entitled to know where the responsibility rests and what financial obligation is cast upon the Government. We are asked in this Bill to vote for the Government a sum of £100,000. For what? We know that freight has not to be paid for as it is ordered - that is not the custom of the trade. Elder, Smith, and Company and Gibbs, Bright, and Company, according to the arrangement which has been made with the Government, have a right to charter, on behalf of the Commonwealth, the necessary freight. That will involve the Commonwealth in a liability, which is being shared by the States, of probably £6,000,000. Who can say that the price of freights will be maintained, and that the wheat shippers will take them off the Government's hands ? Who can say that there is not a certain element of gambling in this business? We have not been told how much of the liability has to be borne by the States. Whatever loss or profit is made is to be shared by the Commonwealth and the States, but in what proportion? The House is entirely without knowledge of this arrangement. The Attorney-General has just said that he is sending to one of his partners, the Victorian Minister of Agriculture, for information; but the House should have been in possession of that information long ago. Parliament has to accept the responsibility, and vote the necessary money, and it may have to accept a proportion of the loss if there should be a sudden drop in freight. In the very unlikely contingency of this war terminating immediately, the inevitable result would be the release of mercantile shipping, and freights would drop. In that event, if freights had been chartered by the Commonwealth, and had not been requisitioned by the buyers, the Government must make a considerable loss. That is why I am saying that it was unwise for the Government to enter into a business undertaking of this character unless there was pressing necessity for so doing. In the serious position that had arisen on account of the shortage of freights and the increase of prices, the Government had the right to ask for an assurance from those who ordinarily handle this trade that they would be in a position to carry out their arrangements as usual. We know that one result of the action taken by the Government is that the large operators in grain are standing off the market, and to-day farmers cannot sell one bag of wheat for forward delivery, as they have been able to do in ordinary years. There has been a substantial drop in the price of wheat in the world's markets during the last week or so. Wheat is down to-day to a parity of about  4b.  in Australian ports. A little while ago the price was 7s. to 8s. per bushel on the home market. Australia's entire export shipping amounts, in round figures, to 10,000,000 tons per annum, and  the import shipping to about 5,000,000 tons a year. Why was wheat, alone, selected for Government interference? If the principle of State acquisition of freights be right, have the Government no concern for other commodities ? Are they not concerning themselves with regard to wool freights? The prevailing custom in regard to the shipment of wool is that the freight is fixed in Australia by the Overseas Shipping Association, and probably the two firms which the Minister has selected for this job are members of that association. My contention in the early stages of this business was that if the Commonwealth ' desired to secure any means of bearing down the value of freights as against the shipping rings of the world, the right course of action was not to go to the agents of those shipping rings, and ask them to beat down their principals. Those firms have reached their present position of commercial ascendency as the directagents and representatives of the big organizations which the Commonwealth now asks them to assist in beating down. If the Government were anxious to adopt the best means of securing cheap freights, they would have gone to the  *bond fide*  brokers, who understand the business, who know every bottom on the waters, and have such an organization that every time even a tub is chartered they are advised. I am afraid it is rather too late to endeavour to remedy the position. The Attorney-General has argued in this House that if there was to be competition by the wheat-shippers from Australia in order to secure freights from the other side of the world, the shipping people would be raising the prices against the Commonwealth; therefore, he thought it would be better to have one buying agency. My answer to that argument is this : Whilst, on the face of it, that contention may look arguable, it must be remembered that Australia produces not more than 3 per cent, or 4 per cent, of the world's wheat, and we must pay at least the world's price for shipping. Nothing the Commonwealth may do is going to particularly bear down the price ; but, on the contrary, I believe the arrangement which has been arrived at is likely to increase the price. The largest wheat-buyers in Australia are John Darling and Son, Bell and Company, and Louis Dreyfus, and their mode of operations is this: An inquiry goes forth for freight, and an immediate response is received by their own organization. They set to work to ascertain if they can sell cargoes, and if they have the wheat available business results. If they do not obtain buyers, there is no obligation on them to accept the freights. But in this Government transaction there is an obligation on the Commonwealth to buy, so that when the Government's representatives go on the market they go as definite buyers - they must buy, and the shipping world knows that. Then comes the opportunity for the great shipping concerns to say, " The Commonwealth is trying to bear down the prices, but we know that the Commonwealth &lt; must buy, whereas the shippers need not buy, and, therefore, we only quote them such prices as will leave them a working margin." I "think that is a rational view to take of this transaction. There is an entire absence of information as to the basis on which the allotment of space is to take place. How do the representatives of South Australia, for instance, know the proportion in which space is to be allotted to that State? What information have we been given as to what, proportion will be allotted for flour, wheat, barley, oats, or other produce? The bargain seems to have been made in a most casual way. I admit that several times the Attorney-General has changed his ground and altered his arrangements until gradually the business is being licked into shape, but that is mainly the result of the criticism from this side of the House. The whole transaction would have benefited in regard to many of its features by consultation between the Government and the representatives of the interests .involved. I could, if necessary, deal with other phases of the agreement, and point to various anomalies; but I shall confine myself to the statement that there was never any justification for this action on the part of the Commonwealth. There was at no time a demand by the wheatgrowers, by the trade, or by the States; but there was a desire on the part of the Attorney-General to make such an arrangement. That desire found expression in an attempt by him to get his partners in this agreement into line on terms of which all of them did not approve. The honorable gentleman told us that in the action he was taking he had the cordial co-operation of the States and of all the interests involved. For three days, however, many of those interests were at bay; they were bargaining and changing their position. It was only at the point of the bayonet - in order that no further dislocation might be caused by one State standing out while others entered into the agreement - that the bargain was ratified. I hope that in respect of any future bargaining of this character, affecting any exportable product of Australia, the same method will not be adopted; but that reasons will be given for the action taken, and that those primarily concerned - the producers - will have an opportunity to state their case. 

##### Mr POYNTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Grey</small>

.- I entirely concur with much, that has been said by the honorable member for "Wannon, although I differ altogether from the opinion expressed by him that there was no demand for this arrangement. 

##### Mr Tudor:

-- Questions were put to me by honorable members on both sides of the House as to what steps we intended to take for the handling of the wheat harvest. 

##### Mr POYNTON:

-- I was about to mention that fact. The question was also raised in the press and in every State Parliament, and it was suggested that the State and Federal Governments should take concerted action to secure freights for the forthcoming harvest. The AttorneyGeneral, in his anxiety to meet the public clamour, made a mistake in the way that he proceeded to take action. In the first place, he should have called to his counsel those who were directly interested, not only the shippers or charterers, but those who desired to secure storage for the wheat they purchased. I certainly would have consulted such people. At the same time, 1 wish to compliment the AttorneyGeneral upon having arrived, after some delay, at what seems to me to be a much fairer basis than that of the original proposition. I was amazed when he made a statement in the House that the Governments concerned were going to retain the difference of 3f per cent, in the 5 per cent, rebate allowed. After consideration, he apparently came to the conclusion that there was no justification for such a course. , . 

##### Mr Sampson:

-- It was the conference with the States that settled that point. 

##### Mr POYNTON:

-- Not at all. Some of the States, according to a press report, seemed to think that the retention of this surplus would be a very fine thing for them. It is idle to complain of what has been done. It cannot be denied that before this agreement was arranged there were indications in every direction of a serious shortage of freights. We also knew that enormously' high rates were being paid, and that there was a possibility of the demand for freights increasing those rates. I thoroughly agree with the honorable member for Wannon that it would have been well to consult large buyers and charterers, who employ some of the brightest men in the trade to secure charters. Had they been approached in the right way no doubt they would have been willing to place at the disposal of the Attorney-General most of the information possessed by them. After all, it will be found necessary to go to these men in order to secure freights. Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and Company, and Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company do not propose to provide for all the freight. Acting as a kind of middlemen, they are to make arrangements with others to carry some of the produce. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- And those other persons will secure a commission? 

##### Mr POYNTON:

-- Yes. Having regard to all the circumstances, I think that the Attorney-General is to be complimented on what he has done. 'I pay my tribute to his great courage, and to the capacity he has displayed in dealing with a number of very important questions. He has had to deal with the metal exchange business, the question of alien contracts, the arrangements for handling the wheat harvest, and the sugar business. In addition to attending to all these matters, he has been at the beck and call df every other Minister, because he is the only lawyer in the Cabinet. I marvel that he has got out of this as well as he has done. The statement made by him last night, in reply to the Leader of the Opposition, and the reply also given by him to a question which I put last Friday, have eased my mind with regard to the disposal of the surplus of the 3£ per cent, of rebate. There may be some charges to be deducted from that surplus, but they will be trifling. I do  not think that in the past the wheatgrower got the whole of the difference, and I am sure that the honorable member for Wannon does not think so. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

--  No; they got not the whole, but practically the whole of it. 

##### Mr POYNTON:

-- It sometimes pays a buyer to advance the price of wheat in certain localities, particularly when he desires to make up a cargo. What concerns me mostly is how the AttorneyGeneral is going to return the surplus rebate to those who should receive it. I hope he will be careful. The cooperation of the States should prove valuable, but it seems to me that this money can be returned to the growers only by means of rebates on freights. Care must be taken that such rebates go to the actual producers of the wheat. Even under such a system it will not be possible to reach all the growers, because wheat is raised in many districts where there are no railways, and where it has to be carted over long distances, so that producers there would not receive any rebate. Speaking generally, I think we can congratulate ourselves on the action that has been taken, and that the Attorney-General can congratulate himself that he has got out of the whole business as well as he has done. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wimmera</small>

.- I agree with the honorable member for Wannon that the questions put to the Attorney-General in this House, and the subsequent Conference which he held with the State Premiers, have had the effect of considerably improving the agreement as originally proposed. This House, however, has not been treated as it should have been. The AttorneyGeneral should have placed before us the terms and conditions agreed upon as between himself and the States. I have a shrewd suspicion that the honorable gentleman agreed with the State Ministers in Conference to rebate to them the whole of the 5 per cent, over and above the 4d. per ton necessary to pay the agents who chartered the vessels- 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

--  .Fourpence per ton is not the gross amount. In some cases it may run up to Sd. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- Other reasonable charges may be added. The main object that we have in view is to make adequate arrangements for the handling of the harvest. Information from the wheatgrowing districts of Australia indicates that we shall probably have next season a record harvest, and the largest export of wheat in the history of the Commonwealth. It is highly necessary that complete arrangements should be made for the export of our surplus wheat, not only that we may be better fitted to prosecute the war, but that we may supply the Allied Forces abroad in the event of large supplies of wheat from other parts not being released for that purpose. The provision of the necessary freights was then the allimportant consideration. 1 am not very sanguine of any material reduction in rates under any system of agency or brokerage. My experience as a member of the Fruit Commission, which travelled all over Australia, is that freights are generally the same all over the Commonwealth. There are no material differences. It is possible to secure a reduction only by going into the market as some spirited agents in Australia have done, and making arrangements for years ahead, guaranteeing a certain quantity of freight and possessing the ability to fill up any dead space if the particular product arranged for is not available. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

--  But the Commission found that the man who made his own arrangement made the best bargain. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- Yes; but he was able to do so only by guaranteeing freights for several  year3  ahead. 

##### Mr Tudor:

--  Has he got the freight for next year at the same price? 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- Yes, we had instances of the kind. 

##### Mr Tudor:

--  He has not got it. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- I am speaking of sworn evidence given before the Commission that freights were arranged for  a  period of four years ahead at 15 per cent, less than the ordinary average price in respect of liners coming to Australia. 

##### Mr Tudor:

--  Is he likely to get the same rate for the next season ? The honorable member says he has the same rate, whereas I say he has not. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- I am not discussing the present abnormal position, but merely saying there might be a possibility of smart agents agreeing for a certain quantity of space, and so arranging the timetable and other matters as to obtain a sub-  stantial concession. Our general experience is not in favour of the view that there is likely to be any considerable reduction; and we should have some information as to how the space is to be regulated. We do not know how far it will be possible to arrange for the filling of space, or what is going to be done where it is ordered and not filled. We might find the shippers, under the latter circumstances, demanding a certain amount of money. We are speaking largely in the dark; and we should have been told who were called into the counsels of the AttorneyGeneral and the State representatives at the conference in Victoria. At the conference with the Ministers of Agriculture, the Attorney-General modified his proposals by stating that all the surplus amount of the 5 per cent, over and above the actual expenses should be rebated to the growers; but, so far as we know, not one grower or representative of the growers was consulted. 

##### Mr Mathews:

-- The shipper has never been consulted. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- But the Government are constantly declaring that the Labour party is against the middleman, and in favour of the real producer of the wealth of the country ; and yet, when much could have been done on behalf of the primary producer, the latter was not consulted in the fixing of the freightage, although he has had to bear the burden of the drought, and now expects the best terms to enable him to recover. 

##### Mr Mathews:

-- Do you not think the proposed arrangement is better for the grower than the ordinary shipping arrangements ? 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- I think that, in some instances, the freight will prove to be higher than if it had been arranged by smart and experienced business men. The redeeming feature of the agreement is that there is a possibility now of being able to secure the necessary amount of space ; but, so far as the business side is concerned, it is probable that not the best class of man has been appointed to drive a hard bargain, and, save, perhaps, some portion of the money paid on behalf of the growers. There is no doubt that the producers should have been consulted before the agreement was ratified. Even now we do not know what took place at the conference between representatives of the States and the Commonwealth ; but we do know that, after all, the 5 per cent. usually allowed by the shipping companies is largely the profit that ordinary dealers secure every year on their wheat export transactions. It is possible, with this 5 per cent., for them to go into the market, as they do, and givethe full amount for the wheat less the actual freightage, depending entirely on the commission for the profit. If anything less than the full amount, less the bare expenses, is rebated to the growers, there will be an injustice done. I regret that we have had to debate the question without full information before us ; and I hope that, if there are any official papers, we shall have an opportunity to scrutinize them, in order that we may know what interests were represented when the AttorneyGeneral, at the instance largely of this House, had a conference with the States, and brought about a modification of the agreement by affording relief to the growers to the extent of a return of the great bulk of the 5 per cent. 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- The honorable member for Wannon, like myself and others who represent country constituencies, looks at this question principally from the stand-point of the producers. At any rate, that is the stand-point which I desire to take, and which I have always taken. My only concern is that such arrangements shall be made as shall assure the producers that they will get their produce away on the very best terms. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- That is all I am concerned about. 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- There will be a greater certainty of this under the proposed arrangement than if the producers were left to the mercy of those brokers and others who do not live by giving concessions to producers. 

##### Mr Gregory:

-- Have we got away from the brokers? 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- The honorable member is speaking of one set of brokers, while I am speaking of another. The brokers, agents, and middlemen whom I desire to cut out are those who, in the past, have not, to say the least, been influenced by consideration for the farmers; and I think that the agreement will result in the disappearance of a great number of those undesirables. The honorable member for Wannon said that there was no necessity for this proposed arrangement; but does he know that the mercantile marine has been lessened to the extent of some 30 per cent.? Under the present abnormal conditions, the Government would have shirked their responsibility if they had not taken some action. 

##### Mr Sampson:

-- The question is whether the Government have made the best business arrangement. 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- I agree with the honorable member for Wimmera in the hope that the agreement will not be accepted until there has been an opportunity for thorough investigation. There is no doubt that we should have seen the agreement, though I regard it as a start on the right lines, in view of the depletion in our mercantile marine. Under the agreement, the farmers of the country have an infinitely better chance of favorable terms than if they were left to the mercies of what I may call a shipping ring. As to the rebate of 3^ per cent., the Attorney-General said that the Government were going to " stick to it." With that attitude I do nob agree. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- There was a chorus of laughter over that. 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- There was a chorus of objections. Now, however, the Attorney-General has told us that it is not so, but that the rebate is going back to the States. 

##### Mr Sampson:

-- That was one of the results of the conference. 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- It was brought about owing to representations made by the honorable member for Grey, and others of us, to the Attorney-General. However, the honorable member for Wannon still seems to have an objection; and that is what makes me believe that he is not so much concerned about the benefit to the farmer as about the benefit to somebody else. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- That is not a fair statement. 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- Perhaps it is a little too strong; but, at any rate, there will be a better chance of the rebates going back into the pockets of the producers. The States, of course, own the railways, and this gives a further chance of the money - though not, perhaps, to a penny - reaching the producers. However, as I have said, my great concern is that the growers shall have an assurance that their produce shall be got away, because it would be absolutely dangerous to their interests and to the interests of the community, if the arrange ments were in a haphazard way left to the shipping rings. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">Dampier</small>

.- I cannot allow the debate to close without entering an emphatic protest. I object to the Government entering into huge business arrangements regarding matters of which they have no knowledge. It has been shown that the Attorney-General has climbed down, and, apparently, from beginning to end, has not known where he was. This, of course, is bound, in the end, to react on the producers. In the second place, I object to our being asked to ratify an agreement of which we have no knowledge; such a position is derogatory to Parliament, and there can be no reason why the question should have been submitted at the last moment. There has been ample time since the agreement was first arranged to afford the House the fullest information. In the third place, I object to a monopoly being given to any two firms. The Government might have employed firms to assist them, and have done a great deal of good in providing the necessary space, but there was no need to give a monopoly. I do not regard the agreement as in any sense in the interests of the producers, and, therefore, I am opposed to it. I do not propose to enter into any argument at this stage. I simply protest against the agreement being ratified without honorable members having any knowledge of its contents. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time. 


 *In Committee:* 


Clause 1 agreed, to. 

Clause 2 (Treasurer may borrow moneys from the Commonwealth Bank). 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

.- May I bring this point under the notice of the Attorney-General % An exceptionally heavy harvest is in sight, a portion of which will go abroad as wheat, and a portion as flour. An opportunity now occurs for Australia to increase her output of flour. For the first six months of the wheat season, flour is in demand abroad. In the second half Australian millers are beaten by the Americans. Now is the opportunity to grist more flour in Australia. Extended operations in this direction will absorb labour when there is unemployment, and it will make available offal as well as flour for cheap home consumption. I would suggest to the At- torney-General that he should confer with the flour millers of Australia, and perhaps by making some concession in the matter of freight it may be possible to do something in this matter. 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; West Sydney &middot; ALP</small>

-- I shall be quite willing to do what the honorable member suggests, though it mustbe understood that I cannot move without the cooperation and approval of the States. At the recent conference the question of flour export was considered, and it was agreed that facilities for the shipment of flour should be afforded just as for wheat. The honorable member for Wannon would go further than that.  His  suggestion is that such inducements should be offered as may lead to the production of more flour in Australia, and to the export of flour rather than of wheat. That is a perfectly sound policy, and the Commonwealth Government will be very glad to support it. The adjourned State conference will meet on 15th October or thereabouts. In the meantime I will write to the various State Ministers of Agriculture inviting their opinions on this matter, and asking for suggestions as to how best it can be carried out. I will further suggest that a conference should be held with flour millers. The Government will be glad not only in this matter, but in any other, to encourage the producer, whether he be a primary or a secondary producer. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- And now that the bargain is made we will do all that we can to help in carrying it out. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I shall be very pleased if that be the case. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wimmera</small>

-- Can the Attorney-General give the Committee any information as to what tonnage may be expected from the interned vessels or from the vessels that will be used by the Defence Department? 

##### Mr Hughes:

-- It is difficult to say, but we expect to be able to carry 250,000 tons. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- That is half the amount specified in the agreement ! Will any commission be paid to brokers in respect to that space ? 

##### Mr Hughes:

-- No; if they do any work we shall pay them a fair rate, but there will be no commission. 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; West Sydney &middot; ALP</small>

-- May I explain that freight has been allotted to each State upon the basis of its amount of exportable wheat. The same principle will be adopted in regard to the allocation to individuals. Every shipper will be treated fairly, and no preference will be given to a State over an individual. Everybody, whether he be John Jones, or a State Government, will be treated exactly alike. If one man happens to get a larger assignment of freight this month he will get a smaller assignment next. Everybody will be treated fairly and in order. The matter is to be discussed in detail in October, when shippers will be able to bring forward definite requirements. The committee will then deal with them and allocate what ships are to be used. 

##### Mr Gregory:

-- May I ask the AttorneyGeneral if he intends to adopt the same policy in regard to this freight as was adopted in regard to sugar; if so, will the freight be less from Western Australia to London than from New South Wales? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- It may be that some vessels will fill up entirely in Western Australia, though it does not follow that the freight from Western Australia will vary from that from Sydney. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- It will be an " all porta " option. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I am not going to commit myself definitely. The question presents as many difficulties as that asked by the honorable member for Corangamite about the bull. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

.- The Attorney-General's statement regarding the allocation of space is reasonable, but I can foresee a little difficulty. The Commonwealth will have bought the freight. Shippers, however, will not have bought the wheat, and will not have requisitioned the space. The market may be drooping, and shippers may be inclined to wait in order to obtain a cheaper freightage. 

##### Mr Hughes:

-- They will not be able to do that. That will not be permitted. 

Clause agreed to. 

Clause 3 agreed to. 

Clause 4 (Interest). 

##### Mr SAMPSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wimmera</small>

.- Can the Attorney-General say from what fund interest payments will be made ? 

##### Mr Hughes:

-- There are large funds to the credit of the Commonwealth in the Commonwealth Bank. Until those funds are overdrawn interest payments will not be necessary. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- One fund will be balanced against the other. 

##### Mr Hughes:

-- Yes. 

##### Mr SAMPSON:

-- I should like to know from the Attorney-General what arrangements have been made in regard to the filling of space. Space must be ordered in advance, and when so ordered must be filled within a fixed period, or otherwise demurrage will be charged on account of the ship. With a bumper harvest, there may be congestion on the railway lines, making it impossible for consignments to arrive in time. What arrangements have the Government made in regard to this matter other than those which usually apply ? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; West Sydney &middot; ALP</small>

-- The usual chartering agreement will be made. If we charter space and cannot fill it, we must still pay for it. 

##### Mr Sampson:

-- I should like the AttorneyGeneral to consider whether some agreement cannot be come to which will make the conditions more flexible. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I shall do that. 

Clause agreed to. 

Clause5 (Closing of account). 

Amendment (by  **Mr. Hughes)**  proposed - 

  >That the clause be negatived, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following new clause: - " S. If the Treasurer is of opinion that there no longer exists any need for the continuation of the Commonwealth Treasurer Freight Arrangements Account, the Treasurer may close the account, and thereupon the balance of the Account, if a credit balance, shall be transferred to the ConsolidatedRevenue Fund, and, if a debit balance, shall be payable out of the ConsolidatedRevenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated for that purpose accordingly. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

.- As it is proposed to amend the Bill, it will be entirely at the discretion of the Treasurer as to when the agreement shall terminate. I respectfully submit that we should not agree to an arrangement which may be continued as the policy of the country after the war. I think that we should provide that the present arrangement shall not continue for a greater period than the currency of the present war. 

##### Mr Watt:

-- Then it will be best to add a proviso. 

Amendment (by  **Mr. Hughes)**  agreed to - . 

That the following words be added to the proposed new clause: - "Provided that this Act shall continue in operation during the present wheat season, but thereafter shall not continue in force after the expiration of six months from the end of the present war." 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- The effect of this provision might be to extend the arrangement over a second harvest. That should be provided against. 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; West Sydney &middot; ALP</small>

-- I promise that the arrangement shall not be continued over a second season until this House has had an opportunity to review the whole question without prejudice. The amendment is intended to limit the operation of the measure to the present harvest, and to give the House an opportunity to approve or disapprove of any extension of it. I think that with that assurance the amendment may be accepted. 

Amendment of the amendment agreed to.

### MR. ATLEE HUNT


 **Mr. MAHON** (Kalgoorlie - Minister of 

External Affairs) [4.30]. - Judging by statements made in this Chamber, some misapprehension exists concerning the visit of the Secretary of my De- partment to the Northern Territory. That visit was made expressly at my request, at very short notice, and at considerable personal inconvenience to  **Mr. Hunt,**  who has done, and is doing, excellent work. He has visited Bathurst and Melville Islands, and Alligator River, and states that he is quite satisfied with the progress made by the mission at the first named place, " considering that the settlement was established among natives previously untouched by white man's influence." He then proceeded  *via*  Melville Island to Alligator River, by the  *Leichhardt,*  and up the river for about 40 miles to Cahill's Settlement, which place he considered most satisfactory for an aboriginal station. He also says that it offers very fine promise as a centre of possible dairy settlement, and that portion of the original shipment of cows from Queensland was successfully taken across a wide stretch of country between Burrundie and the Alligator River, and are now in most excellent condition on fine flats adjacent to Cahill's homestead, where first-class butter is being produced with most primitive appliances and with practically no previous experience on the part of Cahill and his wife. He says that the whole place is an excellent illustration of what a man of energy can do. He then travelled overland 160 miles to Burrundie, visiting Mount Well's mine  *en route,*  carefully examining the country passed over, which, he says, is of a most varied description. He reports that extensive flats prevail in the neighbourhood of the Alligator River, which are mostly under water in the wet season, but are now covered with abundant grasses of a good quality. He carefully considered the prospects of that particular district as a settlement for returned soldiers, but he says that any proposal of that kind would involve a large amount of expenditure. Then he inspected the settlers' properties on the Daly River. He says generally the settlers are not doing well, but he is convinced that it is due to their own incapacity, as at Stapleton and Daly there are individuals who are certainly making good. He inspected the copper mines at the Daly River, which, he says, promise well. Then he motored to Brock's Creek and Mount Bonney to inspect a mine, which, he says,  is carrying out developmental work. He also inspected the Iron Blow Mine, now 

Government property, which is being unwatered. He proposed to leave on Friday last to inspect construction works and visit the Argentine settlers, and to join the Administrator at Katherine on Monday next, for the purpose of visiting Marranboy and Mataranka and the Roper River.

.- On the 15th August I asked the PostmasterGeneral if it was true that the Public Service Commissioner was evading the Arbitration Court's award in regard to letter sorters by imposing a barrier test; if so, what action did the Minister propose to take. The Minister replied - 

  >A reply from myself and the Public Service Commissioner is in the hands of the organization, and we are awaiting their reply. On presentation of the case to myself, some modification was made in regard to a matter objected to, and I am hopeful that the question will be finally settled. 

This morning I asked the PostmasterGeneral if any finality had been reached in the matter. But it appears that he is waiting for a reply from the Letter Sorters Union, while the union is waiting for a reply from him. It looks as if the Minister is a party to a move to sidestep the award of the Court which he was instrumental in establishing, and I think he was, to some extent, responsible for the letter sorters taking their case to the Court. The union went to the Court, and' asked for shorter hours and higher minimum and maximum rates of pay. His Honour fixed the minimum at £150 for sorters at present in the Service, and £168 for future appointees. All the sorters now engaged had passed a certain test qualifying them for their positions, and the Commissioner now says that they must pass a new test before they can enjoy the benefits of the award. I have failed to discover in His Honour's award that he directed the holding of any such examination, and one cannot wonder that the sorters propose to issue a writ of mandamus to prevent the imposing of this barrier test. If the Commissioner has power to force a test on the men at this stage, he has power to enforce it on them at any other stage, and so prevent officers from getting promotion. I understand that so far no application to undergo the test has been made by the sorters, although such application must be made before the 15th of the present month. Men have been prevented from getting increases to which they would have been entitled under the old order of things from the 1st August, and thus are deprived by this new regulation of increments which they would have obtained had they not gone to the Court at all. I shall read portions of the regulation regarding this barrier test, and I ask the Postmaster-General whether it is reasonable to condition in this way the increments to men already in the Service. I do not think there is any necessity for the test, and I shall show that it is altogether unreasonable. The regulation reads - 

  >The passing of the prescribed Sorting Test constitutes one of the conditions governing advancement beyond the Efficiency Bar (£168), as fixed by Arbitration Court Award. 
  >
  >Sorters presenting themselves for examination will be required to pass the following test, viz. :  - 
  >
  >
 *Primary Sorting* (Inland). - A series of addressed letters, imitation letters or cards, shall be prepared in each State, representing the total number of post-offices (including official, semi-official, allowance, 'and receiving offices, but excluding metropolitan and suburban offices) in such State. Five hundred of these articles shall  be drawn by the supervising officer to be sorted by the candidate in a maximum time of 14 minutes. The divisions into which these articles must be sorted shall be the actual sorting divisions used in the Mail Branch of the State. 
  >
  >If when the 500 cards have been sorted the candidate has a balance of time available he shall not be permitted to utilize such time to resort any cards which may have been wrongly sorted. 

Boiled down, that regulation means that a number of cards representing various post-offices and semi-official offices throughout the State, excluding the metropolitan area, are to be thrown together; 500 are to be taken out haphazard, and the sorter is to be asked to sort them with a maximum error of 10 per cent. I challenge any officer in the Department to do that. The highest heads in the Department are not able to take up 500 letters addressed to various post-offices in Australia and sort them in fourteen minutes with only 10 per cent, of errors. In regard to geographical knowledge the regulation says - 

  >Knowledge of geography of States of Commonwealth, excluding State in which candidate is employed (already covered by Primary Sorting Test). Names of towns (50 in number) to be selected from official post-offices and  *semi-official*  post-offices in five States in approximate relative proportion to the total number of such offices in each State. Allowance and Receiving Offices not to be included. Candidates will be required to name the State in which each of the 50 towns is situated. Maximum errors allowed will be 5. 

If I were to ask honorable members of this House where the important town of Boonah, in Queensland, was situated, they would not be able to answer. This is a cruel and hard test to impose upon these officers, and although I would not like to accuse the Minister or the Commissioner of deliberately setting up this barrier test for the purpose of depriving officials of their increments-, that will be its effect. "We need not be surprised if, after the 15th of the present month, serious difficulty arises amongst the postal sorters. I hope that some way out of the difficulty will be found, and that the Department will not insist upon applying this test to officers already engaged. We must admit that the postal sorters have done their work remarkably well in the past. Letters have carried to their destination with very little interruption. The officers have many difficulties to contend with in the way of faulty addresses, but, generally speaking, we only hear of their failures, and not of the great amount of good work which they do from day to day. The sorting of mail matter and sending it correctly to its destination is a difficult task, and the small number of errors that comes to light speaks volumes for the efficiency of the postal sorters. 

##### Mr Sampson:

-- Hear, hear! But we require efficient sorters. 

##### Mr SINCLAIR:

-- Yes ; and I have no objection to the test being applied to the men who are now seeking positions in the Department. But it is unjust to impose a test like this upon men who have been twenty years in the Service. I understand that junior sorters are to be dispensed with, so that, unless the officers at present in the Service can pass this test, and so qualify to rank as senior sorters, they will not derive any benefits from the award. I regret that the PostmasterGeneral is not present, but I hope that he will take note of what I have said, and that a way out of the difficulty will be found. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- I have had an opportunity of reading what the Minister. of Defence said to-day in another place in regard to the case of Gunner W. Perry, and I shall explain in a few moments the only objection I have to his remarks. He mentioned the_ paragraph at the end of my letter - " With all greetings re your plucky act, and good luck." Surely it was a plucky act for the Minister to ascend in an aeroplane! I admire any one who will do a plucky act, but if the Minister objects to that admiration he may consider it eliminated from my letter. On the telephone I asked the Minister if he would allow a medical man to attend on the Board which was to examine Perry. He said he would not. I said, " Will you allow me to be present as the member for Melbourne?" He answered " No." " Will you allow m« to have a lawyer present?" "No." Then I asked who would be the members of the Board, but I could not obtain that information. That is the Board which  **Senator Pearce**  sent to examine this' unfortunate man on Monday night. The promise given to me was that the man would not be forced back to the hospital, but could go to some other hospital, where he would get more skilled surgical attention.  **Dr. Meade**  claims that I have gone behind the privilege of Parliament to call him a cowardly liar. He adds, " Such conduct reflects upon the public life of this country when a politician is enabled to traduce in Parliament the honour of a man merely on the uncorroborated  *ex parte*  statements of any man." Does the. Trades Hall Council enjoy parliamentary privilege? Will the next public meeting I shall call to deal with this subject have the protection of parliamentary privilege ? I tell  **Dr. Meade**  again that if he says that Perry is a malingerer he is a liar and a coward. That has been said, and will be said by me at every meeting I have addressed or shall address. I had the greatest difficulty to discover to-day where  **Dr. Meade**  was. The authorities at the Department denied that he was there, and I think a little inquiry regarding this gentleman is advisable. I ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is to be adopted that a Minister shall personally see this man? 

##### Mr Tudor:

-- The Minister for the Navy was present when the suggestion was made, and I understood him to say that he would bring it under the notice of the Minister of Defence. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- If that is done. I shall be very pleased. It is painful to have to listen to these unfortunate stories. Since I spoke this morning, I have been interviewed by a gentleman who drove into the city some of the poor fellows invalided home, who arrived at Port Melbourne this morning. We know how the first party of soldiers invalided home were treated on their arrival here ; and, in passing, I should like to ask whether the doctor who examined this man was one of those who was responsible for the unfortunate hitch that then occurred. The gentleman who waited on me this morning said that among the returned soldiers whom he brought to the city to-day was a man who said that he knew Perry in Egypt and was aware that he had been treated there by  **Dr. Fred**  Bird and  **Dr. Springthorpe,**  but had not been, cured. The returned soldier went on to say, " If I am any judge of a man,' Perry is no malingerer." 

##### Mr MATHEWS:<br><small class="text-muted">Melbourne Ports</small>

-- I regret that it should be necessary to detain honorable members at this late hour, but I wish to put before the House a quotation from a letter I have received from a constituent concerning the treatment meted out in camp to a relative of his. One does not like to be constantly hammering away at the Defence Department, but when cases of this kind are brought before us, it is just as well that they should be mentioned in the House. The quotation is as follows: - 

  >Did you notice in Friday's paper a death notice, the name of Private  Prideau,  from Port Melbourne? Well, that was my late stepbrother's son. He came from Seymour Camp last Monday, ill, and went to the Base Hospital at St. Kilda-road; was there Monday and Tuesday with asthma and bronchial pneumonia. On Wednesday the poor fellow was told to get up by the doctor, and he said he felt too ill. The doctor said "What rot," and got two soldiers to get his clothes on. How the poor fellow got home to Port we don't know, for he came home on Wednesday morning, and was dead on Thursday morning. They sent an ambulance on Thursday night to take him back to the Base Hospital, but he was in his coffin. They got the police's authority, and the Port Melbourne doctor's; but if he had been sent away from any other hospital there would be an inquiry; but coming from the Military Base Hospital, it will need no inquiry, but will be hushed up, so don't talk of enlisting, after that. He was only 24 years, and his mother is broken up over it. 

He was turned out of hospital on the Wednesday, and he died next morning. We hear of many cases of the kind, and there is no redress. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- None whatever. I have had three more cases brought under my notice this morning. 

##### Mr MATHEWS:

-- I have made the statement in this House on two occasions that much of the sickness in camps in Victoria is due to want of proper attention. Men have to wait forty -eight hours to receive medical attention. 

##### Mr Groom:

-- Is there an adequate supply of nurses in the local camps? 

##### Mr MATHEWS:

-- No. The people expect that something shall be done to remove these horrors. My correspondent writes, " No more enlistment after this." How can a man be expected to go out recruiting when he is brought face to face with facts like these? The Minister for the Navy is, unfortunately, not present; but it would seem that he has no jurisdiction over such cases. I place this letter on record as illustrating once more the horrors that have taken place in connexion with recruiting for our Expeditionary Forces. 

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- I wish to enlist the sympathetic consideration of the Minister for the Navy, and, indeed, of the whole Ministry, for the case of young Lieutenant Patterson, an ex-member of the Permanent Forces in Queensland, whose services have been dispensed with by the Department. I do not wish to pre-judge the case in any way, nor shall I ask the House to do so. Lieutenant Patterson has had a brilliant career. He passed with special credit all the examinations to which he was subjected, and his reputation in the Service was that of a brilliant man of very great promise.  His  services were dispensed with in the following circumstances: He applied for service abroad, and although as a lieutenant in the Permanent Forces he was engaged in instructing other officers who were qualifying for service at the front, he was told that he must submit himself for examination. He was not aware until he received a telegram from the Department whether the examination was to take place at Melbourne or Sydney. On arrival at Sydney he found that he had to present himself there for examination. Before leaving Queensland, he was not even aware of the purpose of the call. He felt that he was more than qualified to pass the examination to which he would have to submit, but having made inquiries from other officers as to the nature and purpose of the examination that he was to be called upon to undergo, he determined to withdraw his application to go abroad. He was led to do this because a previous qualifying examination had not been conducted upon lines such as he and other members of the staff considered to be right and fair. It was in those circumstances that he withdrew his application. Subsequent to his leaving Queensland for Sydney, there was paid into his ac- count money to cover his travelling expenses. Later on, he sent in a warrant to secure the total of his travelling expenses, representing about £5. Those expenses were paid to him. When it was reported to head-quarters that he had not submitted himself to this examination, he was asked to make a refund of the expenses that had been paid to him. He declined to do so. He said that, as a military officer, he lived under the military law and regulations; and finally, after considerable correspondence, his services were dispensed with. No charge was made against him. He was dismissed without having an opportunity to put his case. Part of the examination to which he was to submit was oral, and he had had, practically, no prior notice of it. This young fellow - a particularly skilled officer - believing that he was working within the military laws and regulations, declined to accede to the request for a refund of the money paid by way of travelling expenses. As the result, he was dismissed from the Service; but that dismissal, I understand, has not been confirmed by the Executive. I ask the Minister for the Navy to give his very best consideration to this case, and to cause a full disclosure of the whole of the facts to be made, so that this young man shall have, at least, an opportunity to be heard, and in order that the Commonwealth shall not lose a good officer, and that his future career shall not be blighted . 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

.-:-I promised the honorable member for Macquarie that I would bring before the House a question relating to the motion with regard to the building of a Small Arms Factory at Canberra. As that motion has been removed from the notice-paper- 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member cannot now discuss it. 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- I merely desire, on behalf of the honorable member for Macquarie, to obtain an assurance that nothing will be done to give effect to this proposal until Parliament has been afforded an opportunity to discuss and deal with it. In the absence of the Acting Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Affairs will probably give me this assurance, which I think is one to which the House is entitled. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

.- It was arranged to-day that answers to questions on notice, instead of being read in the House, should be handed over to  *Hansard*  for publication. I have not been able, however, to find any answer to question No. 25 on the notice-paper, which I addressed to the Minister for the Navy in regard to certain contracts and transports. I presume there is no objection to the papers being laid on the table. 

##### Mr Jensen:

--  There is, but the honorable member, or any other honorable member, may see the papers at any time. , 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- Is there anything confidential in them ? 

##### Mr Jensen:

--  There is a report from the Auditor-General, but we expect to receive further information from him, and until we do it is not advisable that the papers should be published. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- Are we to understand that the Auditor-General's report is not yet complete, and that, consequently, the Minister cannot make the papers public? 

##### Mr Jensen:

--  I shall not say that. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- I wish to know if there is any objection- to placing these papers on the table of the House later on, so that they may be made public? Certain charges were made, and there has been a certain amount of suspicion ; but I understand that there is nothing of a private nature in the question. 

##### Mr Jensen:

--  I shall hand in the reply to the honorable gentleman's question, so that it may appear amongst the other replies to questions in  *Hansard.* 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- Am I to take it that the Minister does not wish to place the papers on the table? 

##### Mr Jensen:

--  The honorable member, or any other honorable member, may see the papers at the Navy Office. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">Dampier</small>

.- I wish to emphasize my opinion that there should be a strict and impartial inquiry into the administration and methods adopted at the hospitals in connexion with the Defence Department. An instance came under my notice recently, and everything I am going to say I can absolutely verify. A young man who had enlisted, and was at Seymour Camp, became ill, supposedly with meningitis, and on Saturday morning he was sent to Melbourne, and conveyed to the Base Hospital in an ambulance. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon a friend of his went to visit him, but there being .no record of the patient's arrival those in charge said they had no knowledge of him. The friend, however,was very persistent, and he was given permission to go through the hospital. From 3 o'clock until 4 o'clock this friend searched the hospital without success, and then he was told that, as there was no record, such a patient could not be there. However, as the friend apparently was not satisfied, he was given permission to look through the quarantine ward, and at half-past 4 o'clock some soldiers who had also come from Seymour that day said there was a young fellow on the verandah. This proved to be the man, and the facts disclosed that, although he had been at the hospital from half-past 12 o'clock, no record of his arrival had been made, and he had been left on the verandah without any attention from doctors or nurses. I can quite understand that the nurses and medical men may be overworked, and that the fault may not be theirs; but, at the same time, I am quite satisfied that there could not possibly be, in any other similar institution, such bungling and maladministration. I do not wish to reflect on any person, more especially as I understood from the officer in charge that the attendants had to work exceedingly long hours; but we know that, without good methods or administration, there is bound to be failure. 

##### Mr MASSY-GREENE:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

--  The  organization is at  fault. 

##### Mr GREGORY:

-- There is no organization. This young fellow might have been very ill, though I am glad to say he was not suffering from meningitis, andhas since recovered. The complaints that have been made show the necessity for the strictest investigation into the methods of the Department regarding hospitals. There is another matter to which I desire to refer, and in regard to which I am sure I shall receive the support of honorable members representing other parts of the Commonwealth. For the past nine months I have repeatedly spoken of the methods adopted by the Postal Department in Western Australia. The administration in the Defence Department is bad enough, but there is no doubt that the administration of the Postal Department, under the present Postmaster-General, is a good deal worse. The Government of Western Australia constructed a railway running through an area of 190 odd miles, and during its construction the State Government car ried the mails to the people within that area. As soon, however, as the Railway Commissioner took over the line, the PostmasterGeneral declined to pay him his charges ; and from that time on, although, I believe, a train has been running daily, it has not carried mail matter in any shape or form, the Postmaster-General having the mails carried by motor cars, which follow the train. Under proper arrangements, the people within this area could receive their letters perhaps once  a  day, or, at any rate, two or three times  a  week; whereas now they receive them only about once a fortnight. With  a  Labour Government in power in nearly every State, the Postmaster-General should be able to bring sufficient pressure to bear on the State Government to compel the Railways Commissioner, if compulsion be necessary, to carry the mails by train, because it is absolutely absurd that one Government should bear the cost of a train, and another Government should have to provide motor cars in order to carry the mails over the same ground. There are several similar instances in Western Australia, and others in South Australia and Queensland; and if some alteration is not made by the time we meet again, I shall move the adjournment of the House in order that the matter may be discussed, because I feel satisfied that I shall have the sympathy and support of honorable members generally. 

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Maribyrnong</small>

-- I desire to emphasize the remarks made by the honorable member for Moreton, and I hope that the PostmasterGeneral will give them serious consideration. The officers of the Department, or the officers of the Public Service Commissioner's office, are really setting up a barrier to some of the most faithful men in the Service receiving their just due; and, unless some remedy is found, there will be seething insubordination amongst a big section of the employees. The treatment of these men seems to me to amount to persecution, and it leads to the belief that some of the officers in the Public Service Commissioner's office, or in the Post Office, are trying to rob the men of the result of the arbitration award. If that be so, it is a most unjust and unwarranted proceeding. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

House adjourned  at  5.39  p.m.
