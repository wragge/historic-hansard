### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-0-0}
#### ENTERTAINMENTS TAX

##### Mr WATKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">NEWCASTLE, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Iwish to know from the Treasurer how  long  it issince the Government decided to tax entertainments got up by committees for saying farewell to soldiers  going  to  the war  or receiving back men from the Front? 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; SWAN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- I have no knowledge of the matter, but if the honor- . able member will place his question on the notice-paper, I shall be prepared to answer it later.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-1-0}
#### COMMONWEALTH AND STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS

##### Mr FOWLER:<br><small class="text-muted">PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Has the Treasurer seen the report in to-day's  *Age*  of a debate in- the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, at Perth yesterday, during which the statement was made that the Statehas been required by the Commonwealth Treasury to redeem certain Treasury bonds? Does the right honorable gentleman regard this as an act of repudiation, which it is alleged by the exTreasurer of Western Australia to be. Is there any understanding concerning the non-payment of these bonds during the war ? 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I have seen the paragraph referred to. The statement made in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia was not sufficiently clear, and was not based on facts. The ex-Treasurer of the State in using the word " repudiation " did ' so improperly, and without justification. I cannot understand the use of such an expression by men who have had responsibilities. The Commonwealth has lent about £30,000,000 to the States, and under an agreement about £3,800,000 more should be paid to them by us during the present year. But the difficulties in the way of borrowing money should be' as well known to those who spoke on the subject in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia as theyare to honorable members and to me. 

The Commonwealth has behavedmost generously to the States. It wentonto the London market to borrow £7,500,000, and also borrowed £3,000,000 more,with the consent of the British Government, from the War Fund, in order tofulfil its obligations to the States, and to enable their public works to be continued. As I have said, £3,800,000 remains to be paid to the States during this calendar year under the agreement between them and the Commonwealth. When I came into office Idiscovered that the States had borrowed £18,000,000 from the Commonwealth on the understanding that they would pay the money back within two years, it being thought, no doubt, that the war would then be over. At the end of two years, the period of the loan was extended for another year, which  has  now nearly expired. The obligation to pay this money is as binding on the States as  the  obligation to advance them money is binding on the Commonwealth', and a reasonable understanding might be arrived at regarding the two agreements. "A week ago the Treasury telegraphed to the Government of Western Australia, through the Prime Minister, saying that we should do our best to fulfil our promise to advance £3,800,000 more this year, and we hope to find the money to do that. The market is perhaps a little better than it was, but it is not advantageous to go on to the London market for small amounts. Although that telegram was confidential, those to whom it was sent might have prevented the statement which was made about repudiation. 

##### Mr Higgs:

--  Has money been raised for the States which the Treasurer refuses to pay to them? 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:

-- No. We have paid to tie States all. the money borrowed on their behalf. To comply with the letter of the agreement, we must raise a loan of £6,800,000 to repay the £3,000,000 borrowed from the War Fund of the British Government and to provide £3,800,000 more for theStates this year. I believe that we shall be able to do that, though there are difficulties in the way. 

##### Mr Fenton:

--  I understand that the Treasurer is asking the States to pay up? 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:

-- Honorable members have been given all information concerning this matter in the Treasury statements that have been published. I think that the  obligation of the States to pay us the money that they have borrowed under the promise to pay it back is as binding as our obligation to advance further money to them. The two agreements should be looked at together, and an understanding should be come to with regard to th'em. lt is my desire to be generous to the States - and that we have been - but we should be treated generously, too.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-2-0}
#### PAPUAN OIL FIELDS

##### Mr RILEY:<br><small class="text-muted">SOUTH SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Is the Minister for Home and Territories prepared to make a statement concerning the oil finds in Papua ? 

##### Mr GLYNN:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Home and Territories &middot; ANGAS, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- I can make known the general position. Oil' was discovered in Papua about 1911, and in 1913 bores were put down under the advice of an expert. When  **Dr. Wade**  took charge in May, 1915, five bores had been put down, and although oil has been obtained from them, they ceased to be used because of the mud that rose with it, and it was thought better to put down other bores. The plant that was used in the first instance was rather small, and the bores too narrow for deep sinking. Two more bores have therefore been put down, and one of the old bores has been redrilled.  Of the new bores, No. 6 was commenced in 1915, and No. 7 iri October, 1916. Bore No. 6 is down to a depth' of about 500 feet. 

##### Mr Richard Foster:

-- What is the size of the bore ? 

##### Mr GLYNN:

-- I forget the size for the moment. The No. 7 bore is wide enough to get down to at least 4,000 feet, and is now down to about 1,700 feet, at a point determined by the geological knowledge of the expert,  **Dr. Wade.**  It has been successful in respect of quickness of boring, and the fact that as greater depth is attained there is a comparative absence of mud; and there are other indications that the bore will develop well. The actual cost of No. 7 is about £1 16s. per foot. Case artesian boring in Australia costs about 30s. per foot, and when 

I remind honorable members of the exceptional conditions in Papuan - the distance from the source of supply, the fact that the boring is done at places where rain falls every day and averages from 150 to 200 inches per annum, that the natives are attacked by pleurisy and pneumonia, that the site is approached through an almost impenetrable jungle, and that it takes several months to make a road to the site from the nearest point at which the vessel touches - 'they will understand that the enterprisers attended with great difficulty. One cannot compare the outlay from 'the beginning of the enterprise because that might run to about £25 per foot, but comparing the actual cost of drilling with the cost of similar work on other fields in Australia, America, and Russia, the result of No. 7 bore is good. Up to the present time there has been an expenditure of about £65,000. The last bore has been put down at a rapid rate, a depth of 300 feet having been reached in the first month. The cost compares favorably with that on other fields, and at present we have about 2,000 gallons of oil, but commercial quantities cannot be touched until we get down  to a greater depth. The oil is of first class quality, and compares well with that from Sumatra and other parts of the Dutch East Indies. If the boring is successful the results will be of great advantage to the Commonwealth. 

##### Mr BAMFORD:<br><small class="text-muted">HERBERT, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Has the Minister been approached by any person or persons representing private enterprises with a proposition to develop the Papuan oil fields? 

##### Mr GLYNN:

-- There have been many suggestions from the United Kingdom and other places in regard to allowing private persons to engage in this enterprise, but I have not felt justified in acceding to the suggestions.

#### TAXATION OF SOLDIERS' PENSIONS

##### Mr ORCHARD:<br><small class="text-muted">NEPEAN, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Is the Treasurer aware that under the present law soldiers' pensions are subject to income tax ? If so, will he introduce an amending law to exempt them from taxation ? ' 

##### Sir JOHN FORREST:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I believe the House has already been informed that it is the intention of the Government to exempt soldiers' pensions from taxation. A Bill for that purpose will be introduced shortly.

#### LENGTH OF QUESTIONS

##### Mr TUDOR:<br><small class="text-muted">YARRA, VICTORIA</small>

-- I should like to ask you,  **Mr. Speaker,**  if the Standing Orders impose any limit on the length of an answer which a Minister may give to a question, and whether you will allow questioners to ask questions of the same length as some of the answers that have been given this afternoon ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- It seemed to me that the answers referred to were of somewhat unusual length, but the matters to which they related were certainly of very great importance. I would suggest: to Ministers that when a question involves the making of a long statement in reply, it would meet the wishes of the House if they would first obtain leave to make a statement.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-5-0}
#### SOLDIERS LEAVE

##### Mr MATHEWS:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE PORTS, VICTORIA</small>

-- Will the Assistant Minister for Defence make inquiries into the remissness of officials at thedifferent camps in giving soldiers their leave too late to allow of them leaving camp? Many receive their leave after thetrain . has left, or so shortly before the departure of the train that they have no time to catch it. 

##### Mr GROOM:<br><small class="text-muted">Honorary Minister &middot; DARLING DOWNS, QUEENSLAND &middot; NAT</small>

-- The honorable member's question is very vague. If he will give me specific cases I shall make inquiries. The intention of the Department is that every man entitled to leave shall get. it. 

##### Mr MATHEWS:

-- When passes are issued at the Seymour Camp, the men sometimes have not the opportunity to catch the train to Melbourne unlessthey travel by motor car. It would seem that the officials at Seymour are in collusion with the proprietors of the motor cars. Will the Minister look into that specific case? 

##### Mr GROOM:

-- I shall certainly ask that inquiries be made into the case to which the honorable member has drawn attention.

#### CRITICISM OP HIGH COURT JUDGES

##### Mr WEST:<br><small class="text-muted">EAST SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the Prime Minister readin the press a report of statements made by members of the Council of the Employers Federation in New South Wales in criticism of a Judge of the High Court? Have members of the Council of the Employers Federation greater privileges in that respect than are enjoyed by other members, of the community ? If not, what authority exists for protecting High Court Judges from attacks of this kind ? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Attorney-General &middot; BENDIGO, VICTORIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- I have not seen the report; but I shall look at it, and answer the honorable member later.

#### NORTHERN TERRITORY EXPENDITURE

##### Mr McWILLIAMS:<br><small class="text-muted">FRANKLIN, TASMANIA</small>

-- Is the Minister for Home and Territories in a position to give the House the information he promised in regard to the expenditure in the Northern Territory? 

##### Mr GLYNN:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- At the request of the honorable member, I personally prepared a statement on the finances of the Northern Territory, and it has been ready for some time. I thought, however, that I would make two or three additions in regard to agriculture, pastoralism, and mining. I hope to be able to complete the statement next week, and lay it on the table.

#### ADVISORY COUNCIL OF SCIENCE

##### Mr SAMPSON:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA</small>

-- Will the Prime Minister make available the recommendations of the Advisory Council of Science contained in the papers now lying on the Library table? If not, will be explain why the documents are marked " Confidential"? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- The papers we're marked " Confidential and Secret," as all similar papers are marked whenthey are handed to me in the usual way by the Secretaries of Departments. When the Leader of the Opposition asked for the papers, I handed them to him without any alteration of the indorsement. From him they passed on to the Library table with that indorsement, which appears on all official papers. There is nothing confidential or secret about them. They are public property, and may be used as honorable members see fit. I read in the press a criticism in regard to the matter, and I am glad that the honorable member for Wimmera has afforded me an opportunity of explaining that, in an effort to comply with the request of an honorable member, without waiting to remove the red tape, I handed over the papers in the state in which I received them. For that I have been condemned. 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- I wish to know whether the papers are now available, or whether the embargo that any honorable member who wished to peruse them must give his word of honour not to communicate any of the contents to the press still remains on them. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I have not seen the papers. I handed them over as they were handed to me. I have tried to explain how it came about that the words "Secret and Confidential" appeared on them. They were on them when they were handed to me, and every honorable member who has held Ministerial office knows that papers are usually so marked when sent to me by departmental chiefs. No doubt the Librarian, on seeing that inscription upon them, was quite right in demanding from any honorable member that the documents should be read with the qualification to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred. I know ofno reason why the contents should not be published, but I confess that I have not seen the papers and cannot express any opinion until honorable members give me a few moments in which to peruse them.

### QUESTION

#### COST OF RECRUITING

##### Mr PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">MARANOA, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- I have received the following telegram from the Queensland Recruiting Committee: - 

  >Committee instruct me to state that the cost of recruiting in New South Wales, as given in the House yesterday, was totally wrong and misleading. The Queensland figures given include salaries, recruiting employees, office expenses, travelling allowances, rail, steamer, and coach fares of recruiting employees and recruits, also recruits' meals, medical examinations, printing, stationery, advertising, and all the other many contingencies. The New South Wales figures as given cannot possibly cover all these items. Will you please correct.

#### MR. P. J. BROOKFIELD, M.L.A

##### Mr CONSIDINE:<br><small class="text-muted">BARRIER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Can the Prime Minister tell me why  **Mr. P.**  J. Brookfield, the member for Sturt in the Legis lative Assembly of New South Wales, has been prosecuted for an alleged offence in March last, and why such a long period was allowed to elapse before the prosecution was instituted ? I would like to know, also, whether the Prime Minister is aware that the repeated prosecutions of  **Mr. Brookfield**  have created an impression among the workers of Broken Hill that he is being treated very unfairly, in fact persecuted, and that this feeling has grown to such an extent that there has been a total cessation of work in Broken Hill to-day as a protest against the prosecutions ? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- Until I saw a paragraph in the press this morning I was not aware that  **Mr. Brookfield**  had been prosecuted. I confess that as a citizen I frequently wondered why he had not been prosecuted, but as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth I was not officially aware of the fact that he had been. Probably the prosecution referred to is being dealt with by the State magistrates. It may even be that the offence is against a State law. If that is so, the more credit falls on the State law and the greater criticism descends on the Commonwealth law and the Department over which I have the honour to preside. I am not aware that  **Mr. Brookfield**  has been treated unjustly. If he has been treated so, he shall have justice. He deserves justice, but he certainly does not deserve mercy. He will have what the law gives him, but no more. I am not surprised to learn that the men at Broken Hill have ceased work; I should be surprised to learn that they work for any length of time continuously. I am aware that they have threatened to do certain things. I am perfectly aware that it is their practice to do so, and I am sure that when the honorable member for Barrier has been a little longer in this Parliament he will learn that the rumblings which disturb him so greatly affect us not at all.

Such notices are both harassing and hurtful to parents, and I ask the Minister to see that officers are instructed to exercise greater care in this respect.
