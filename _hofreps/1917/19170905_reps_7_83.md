### PAPER

{:#subdebate-0-0}
#### Cost of Recruiting

Mr.GROOM. - The other day the honorable member for Maranoa  **(Mr. Page)**  asked some questions regarding the cost of recruiting in the several States. I promised to get the information, and to make it available as soon as possible, and I now lay on the table a statement showing the details of expenditure on recruiting for the period from the 1st January, 1917, to the 30th June, 1917. The figures relating to the 3rd Military District differ slightly from those given in answer to a question by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie  **(Mr. Heitmann),**  but the cost per recruit for each of the States is unaffected. 

Paper laid on the table.

### TASMANIAN COMMUNICATIONS

##### Mr LAIRD SMITH:<br><small class="text-muted">DENISON, TASMANIA &middot; ALP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- I received this  morning the following telegram from the  Chairman  of the Chamber of Commerce, Hobart : - 

  >Last steamer leaving Hobart for Sydney,  *Moeraki,*  11th August. 150,000 cases apples awaiting shipment, in cool store and growers' hands; also usual weekly exports, including 20,000 cases preserves. Only' ten days' supply of coal on hand for gas. No sugar, other foodstuffs. 

Can the Prime Minister Bay whether a steamer will be put on the Hobart to Sydney service shortly to relieve this rather serious situation) 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Attorney-General &middot; BENDIGO, VICTORIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- If the facts are as stated, I shall do that.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-2-0}
#### CENSORSHIP: NORTHERN TERRITORY

##### Mr MATHEWS:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE PORTS, VICTORIA</small>

-- I ask the Honorary Minister if communications from Darwin are being censored, mutilated, and in many cases slopped altogether. The Department for Home and Territories throws all the responsibility in this matter on the Defence Department. For a week 1 have been expecting communications from Darwin, and have received nothing. I ask the Honorary Minister if communications from Darwin to myself have been censored and stopped, or prevented from reaching me in the ordinary course? 

##### Mr GROOM:<br><small class="text-muted">Honorary Minister &middot; DARLING DOWNS, QUEENSLAND &middot; NAT</small>

-- I know nothing about the matter, and can only promise to make inquiries.

### PERSONAL EXPLANATION

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I wish to make a personal explanation. The honorable member for Capricornia  **(Mr. Higgs)**  is reportedto have said last Friday, referring to contracts between the Government and certain firms engaged in the manufacture of wool tops - 

  >The Government ought  to  lay the list  of  shareholders on the table. Surely thereis nothing to conceal. 

##### Mr Higgs:

--  Is the Prime Minister making a personal explanation ! If so, I ask in what way he has been misrepresented ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The right honorable gentleman has not proceeded far enough to enable me to answer the question. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I have frequently explained that the list referred to was handed to the Wool Committee confidentially, and is regarded by the Committee and the Government as in the same category as returns under the Income Tax Act and other statements made under the seal of confidence. 

##### Mr Higgs:

--  **Mr. Speaker,**  do you regard this as a personal explanation? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I understand that the Prime Minister desires to remove a misapprehension regarding a statement that has been made, or to more fully explain some matter upon which information has been sought. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I rose to make a personal explanation regarding the insinuation of the honorable member for Capricornia that the Government was acting improperly inthis matter. He is reported in  *Hansard*  to have interjected, when the Minister for the Navy was speaking - 

I do not think  that  many members of the Government do know anything about it, meaning the transaction to which I have referred. I submit thatI am as much entitled as any other member to make a personal explanation in regard to a matter in which I have been misrepresented during my absence. 

I also ask permission to make a personal explanation regarding some observations of the honorable member for Maribyrnong  **(Mr. Fenton),**  who, speaking of replies furnished by me earlier in the day, in answer to a. question about food returns, said - 

I asked for returns, and there was a general impression that full information would be given; but when a question was asked, it was laughed  off  with a statement of the number of sheep, tons of sugar, and bushels  of  wheat in  store...... He (the Prime Minister) said that the returns arrived too late. That is  a  reflection on officers engaged in important duties. . 

I have obtained a report from the Department in which it is stated that - 

At the  beginning  of July,  1915,  a monthly census was  taken  of the food  supplies  in Australia.  Stocks in hand  of the following commodities were ascertained: - Beef, mutton, lamb, bacon  and  ham, rabbits, sugar, molasses, cheese, butter, jam, tinned fish, condensed milk, rice. 

I did not deal with all the commodities mentioned, but only with bo many as I had at my fingers' ends at the moment - 

These returns came to hand from month to month until January of this year. The information contained in the replies was tabulated, and was generally available about a month, sometimes longer, after the date up to which the return was prepared. 

In answering the questions of the honorable member for Maribyrnong, I merely stated the facts, and he should have accepted my statement. He may be of opinion that the practice of making thesereturns should be continued, but that is another matter. I told him that the Government were considering the question. We are doing so. 

##### Mr HIGGS:

-- I desire to make a personal explanation, since the Prime Minister has endeavoured, perhaps unintentionally, to show that I have done something which is not quite regular. The questions I have asked in regard to the Colonial Wool Combing and Weaving Company and its list of shareholders are the outcome of a report that a member of the Central Wool Committee is largely interested, financially, in the arrangement by which the Government and the Colonial Wool Combing and Weaving Company share certain profits. I have endeavoured to obtain the list of shareholders. When I asked the Prime Minister for it he replied that the information was not available, but that I could obtain it at the Registrar's Office, Sydney. Search was made at that office, but the share list was not available. I then drew the. attention of the Prime Minister to a clause in the agreement, which provides that the company shall furnish the Government with a list of shareholders and of the shares held by them; but when I asked him for the list he replied, " It is confidential." The position is, therefore, that we cannot obtain the share list at the Registrar's Office, Sydney, and the Government will not supplyus with a copy. If they would do so we should then know to what extent the member of the Central Wool Committee to whom I have referred is interested in the agreement. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is not a fact that a member of the Central Wool Committee is largely interested in the agreement ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member will not be in order in putting a question to the Prime Minister in the course of a personal explanation. 

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">MARIBYRNONG, VICTORIA</small>

-- I also desire to make  a  personal explanation. The reply which the Prime Minister gave to my question was such as to suggest to me that hewas indulging in one of his well-known efforts to put off, by means of a joke, the answering of my inquiry. I thought he treated me in a rather cavalier fashion. 

##### Mr Hughes:

--  I gave the honorable member a very full answer. 

##### Mr FENTON:

-- It was,I think,  a  little overdone. The right honorable gentleman said that one reason why these monthly reports were not now forthcoming was that they were often solate in  being furnished as to be of no real value. In referring to that answer on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Friday, I said that it was either a reflection on the officers called upon to make such returns or it proved the inefficiency of the Government. Other returns are provided in a few days, and, that being so, I should like to know why we cannot obtain equally prompt returns in regard  to so important a matter as the supply of foodstuffs. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order. The honorable member is now going beyond the making of a personal explanation.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-4-0}
#### INDUSTRIAL UNREST

North Queensland Railway Strike

##### Mr MATHEWS:

-- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria have exercised upon him any moral suasion to prevent his intervening to bring about a quietening of the industrial unrest which at present exists? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- This seems to me to be a most extraordinary question, and one that should not properly be asked. I shall, however, answer it. My answer is. "No. Most emphatically, No!" 

##### Mr FINLAYSON:<br><small class="text-muted">BRISBANE, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Will the Prime Minister lay on the table of the House the correspondence that has passed between him and the Premier of Queensland, and any other persons in regard to the industrial dispute on the railways in Northern Queensland? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- There has been no correspondence other than telegrams, all of which have appeared in the press.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-5-0}
#### FIRE ON BOARD SHIP AT ADELAIDE

Rumoured Action of Naval Board

##### Mr POYNTON:<br><small class="text-muted">GREY, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I have a question to put to the Minister for the Navy in regard to a fire which occurred on board a ship at Port Adelaide. Rumour has it that when the fire brigade reached the wharf to assist in putting out the flames the Naval Board authorities insisted on the firemen showing their authority before they went on board the vessel. I ask the Minister whether red-tape exists to such an extent in his Department, and, if so, whether he will take action to get rid of it? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for the Navy &middot; PARRAMATTA, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; NAT</small>

-- I know nothing about the matter, but shall cause inquiries to be made.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-6-0}
#### AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE

Recent Decorations - Special Leave

##### Mr BRENNAN:<br><small class="text-muted">BATMAN, VICTORIA</small>

-- Will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence be good enough to supply the House with the comparative numbers of officers and privates upon whom decorations and distinctions of various kinds have been conferred, as disclosed in the most recent list published; and whether he has any comment to make upon the fact that in the very long list published in this morning's issue of the  *Age,*  extending over two columns, there does not appear the name of one private? 

##### Mr GROOM:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- If the honorable member will furnish me with a copy of his question, I shall have inquiries made with regard to the matter. The honorable member for Corio  **(Mr. Lister),**  on 29th instant, put to me a question with regard to week-end leave, and I promised to have inquiries made. I am now in a position to furnish him with the following reply: 

  >The following instructions with regard to special leave for members of the Imperial Forces were recently sent out: - " (1) Cases have come under notice of men in the Australian Imperial Force Camps, whose homes are in the country districts, and who sometimes find that their business or family affairs necessitate their return for a few days. " (2) In such cases, applications will be submitted to the Camp Commandants, who may, if the circumstances justify, grant such special leave, without pay. " (3) Camp Commandantswill personally deal with all such applications, and carefully consider the circumstances of each case. "(4) This leave should preferably be given so as to include a week-end, in order that the soldier is absent from his training for as short a period as possible." 
  >
  >It was pointed out that it was only intended that additional leave should be granted in cases where it can be shown that business or family affairs necessitate such urgent additional leave, and not to allow men in Camps additional leave in order to visit their homes at week-ends. The training of the troops would seriously suffer if men were allowed such leave indiscriminately.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-8-0}
#### WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT

Disallowance of Regulation

##### Mr WEST:<br><small class="text-muted">EAST SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to notice of motion No. 1, to the effect that the regulation issued under the War Precautions Act, Statutory Rule No. 196 of 1917, and dated 30th August, 1917 - which amends Statutory Rule No. 129a of 1916, Regulation No. 10, previously issued under the Act - be disallowed ? This is an urgent matter, and I desire to know whether the Prime Minister will give an opportunity for it to be brought before the House. 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- As this is an urgent matter, or might become so, I shall make inquiries before this man's rights can become affected in regard to a pending action. I take it that the question is whether I consent  *to*  the prosecution of an action ? 

##### Mr West:

-- Yes. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- If I find I cannot consent, I shall see whether I can give the honorable member an opportunity to discuss the matter. Of course, if I do consent, the honorable member will not require that opportunity. 

##### Mr West:

-- That will do.
