### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-1-0}
#### CENSORSHIP : PROSECUTION OF MR. J. H. CATTS, M.P

##### Mr TUDOR:<br><small class="text-muted">YARRA, VICTORIA</small>

-- Is the Government aware that its prosecution of the honorable member for Cook on two charges was yesterday dismissed by the magistrate, and that the honorable member is nevertheless compelled to pay nisi own costs? Do Ministers think it fair, the Government having lost its case, that an innocent man should pay the costs of the trial ? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for the Navy &middot; PARRAMATTA, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; NAT</small>

-- It is quite true that the honorable member for Cook was acquitted, but it is also true that the magistrate who tried the case declined to award costs. 

##### Mr Tudor:

--  The Government could ruin any man in this way. It would only have to got a complaisant magistrate. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- I suggest to my honorable friends, as an easy way to avoid being ruined, to refrain from making such statements as were made by the honorable member for Cook. 

##### Mr Tudor:

--  Whom the Court found innocent! 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- My honorable friends seem never to be satisfied. As I read the account of the trial in this morning's newspaper, I saved the honorable member. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:<br><small class="text-muted">BATMAN, VICTORIA</small>

-- Since the proceedings were commenced in respect of which the honorable member for Cook has been so completely vindicated, has any order been given to the Government Printer regarding the censorship of  *Hansard?* 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; BALACLAVA, VICTORIA &middot; NAT</small>

--  No instruction has been issued regarding the censorship ofHansard, but an order of one of my predecessors respecting the use of headlines in reprints of speeches has been varied.

#### WHEAT PAYMENTS

##### Mr RICHARD FOSTER:<br><small class="text-muted">WAKEFIELD, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Is the Treasurer yet prepared to make a statement as to the date of the final payment for the 1915-16 and 1916-17 wheat? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I am working on the problem, which is not an easy one to settle. I hope to get daylight through it next week, and shall inform the honorable member of my decision as soon as I am able to do so.

#### HISTORIC PORTRAITS

##### Mr BOYD:<br><small class="text-muted">HENTY, VICTORIA</small>

-- In view of the urgent need of money, will the Treasurer interview the Committee responsible for the expending of £1,250 on portraits of distinguished members of this Parliament, and ask that the matter be deferred until after the war? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- My old friend is hardly kind in setting such a task for a young Minister. I only know what I have read in the press concerning the Committee's determinations. The matter referred to has not yet come before me. When it does, I shall have something to say about it..

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-5-0}
#### WAR WORKERS SENT TO GREAT BRITAIN

##### Mr CHARLTON:<br><small class="text-muted">HUNTER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Is it a fact that the labourers who went to Englandas war workers were guaranteed a minimum wage of£20s. 6d. a week, and that since their arrival in the Old Country, they have been compelled to insure against accident, although that gives them no more than was guaranteed to them before they left. Under the circumstances, ought not the Government to pay their insurance premiums ? 

##### Mr WISE:<br><small class="text-muted">Honorary Minister &middot; GIPPSLAND, VICTORIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- I shall submit the question to the Minister for Defence. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- May I add that last week I received from a man whom I know well -  **Mr. James**  Dickson - who, before he went away as a war worker was  president  of the Randwick Labour League - a letter, in which he asks me to contradict some rumours which he believed to be in circulation regarding the underpayment of these men. 

##### Mr Charlton:

--  I am not complaining of their underpayment. 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:

-- My correspondent told me, among other things, that the menwere able to earn £3 odd a week, and that no man wanting employment need be out of work at those rates. He  asked me to make that information as public as possible. 

##### Mr Charlton:

--  I hold a letter to the same effect.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-6-0}
#### HANSARD REPRINTS

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- As the Treasurer is in control of the Government Printing Office, and presumably in charge of reprints of honorable members' speeches, I would like to ask him if it is necessary for honorable members to submit their speeches to the censor before they can obtain reprints of them ? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- The Treasurer happens to be in charge of the Government Printing Office, but he does not deal with the censorship. 

##### Mr TUDOR:

-- Can the Minister representing the Minister for Defence answer the question? 

Mr.WISE. - I ask the honorable member to give notice.

#### SHIPBUILDING

##### Mr McWILLIAMS:<br><small class="text-muted">FRANKLIN, TASMANIA &middot; REV TAR; ANTI-SOC from 1906; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917; CP from 1920; IND from 1928</small>

-Is it possible for the Minister for the Navy, or the Honorary Minister in charge of shipbuilding, to make some statement to the House in regard to the shipbuilding programme, the class of vessel intended to' be built, and the orders which have already been given for the construction of vessels? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I hope to supply that information in a few minutes.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-8-0}
#### ESTIMATES FOR 1917-18

##### Mr HIGGS:<br><small class="text-muted">CAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- When does the Treasurer propose to give' the House an opportunity to consider the Estimates for 1917-18? Does he propose to prevent the discussion of the Estimates by means of the Supply Bill which he has put before us? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- There is no desire on the part of the Government to prevent the House dealing with the Estimates, andas soon as possible they will be brought before the Committee of Supply. 

##### Mr MATHEWS:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE PORTS, VICTORIA</small>

-- It is very evident, according to inspired information, that we may close down in three weeks' time until next October. I would like to know whether the Estimates will be considered during the financial year? 

##### Mr WATT:

-- I know nothing of the value of the inspired information to which the honorable member refers, but if it is agreeable to honorable members, it is the intention of the Government to deal with the Estimates during this financial year.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-9-0}
#### COMMONWEALTH BANK

Loan Contributions

##### Mr FALKINER:<br><small class="text-muted">HUME, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- In view , of the large amount which we have to raise by way of war loans and by means of direct taxation, I would like to know from the Treasurer whether the Government still consider it inthe public interest to pay all the money so raised into one bank, or whether they could not adopt what I understand is the custom in England, America, and Canada of allowing the money to remain in the banks which find it for their clients until the Treasury need it? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I find that it has been the practice in connexion with the fivepreceding war loans to shift the whole of the contributions to the loans from the other banks to the Commonwealth Bank. I  cannot see my way clear to altering that system as regards the present loan, which was partially arrangedbefore I was intrusted with acting functions concerning it, but I have already discussed the matter with those dealing with these matters, and I propose to re-open the question at the conclusion of the present transactions.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-10-0}
#### IMPERIAL CONFERENCE

##### Mr HIGGS:

-- A telegram which appeared in yesterday morning's press states that the Minister for the Navy could not definitely say that the delegation to the Imperial Conference would be the Prime Minister and himself. I would like to ask the right honorable gentleman if he has noticed that  **Senator Millen**  has stated definitely that the delegates will consist of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy ? Further, if the Prime Minister and the right honorable gentleman are to go to the Imperial Conference, I would like to know if they intend to tell the House what they propose to say or do at that Conference, and what subjects, if any, they propose to deal with on behalf of Australia, and their views thereon ? 

##### Mr JOSEPH COOK:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- The honorable member asks a very comprehensive question. As to the telegram to whichhe alludes, he will observe that I did what I thought was proper in the circumstances. I said that any communication made on the matter would be first made to the House, and that it would be so made in a few days. As to the other matters contained in the. honorable member's question, I know so very little about the things that are proposed to be discussed at the Imperial Conference that I am sorry that I cannot tell the honorable member beforehand what will be said or done there.

### QUESTION

#### AMERICAN SHIPS

##### Mr BOYD:

-Will the Honorary Minister in charge of the importation of American vessels undertake to see that the wooden ships being built there and coming to Australia are equipped with centrifugal pumps, because the last vessel that arrived here built in the American States was making 6 feet of water in twenty-four hours? It is very essential that these things should be looked into before the vessels leave, seeing that thelives of the crews are in danger. 

##### Mr POYNTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Honorary Minister &middot; GREY, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- I shall be very pleased to have inquiry made into the matter in order to see if it is necessary to take any steps in the direction which the honorable member indicates.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-12-0}
#### PROMOTION BY MERIT

##### Mr CHARLTON:

-- Has the Minister representing the Minister for Defence noticed a cablegram which states that, in future, promotions in the British Army will be based on merit, and not on seniority, and can he state whether that method will apply also to the Australian Forces ? 

##### Mr WISE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I will bring the honorable member's question under the notice of the Minister for Defence.

#### AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE

Alterations of Pay

##### Mr WISE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- On Thursday last, the honorable member for Hunter  **(Mr. Charlton)**  submitted the following question :  - 

  >Is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence aware that considerable delay occurs in forwarding from abroad official advice in regard to alterations made in the payments to our soldiers, and that consequently there is a good deal of dissatisfaction on the part of dependants? Will the honorable gentleman take action to expedite the receipt of such official information ? 

The answer is as follows :  - 

  >Isolated cases of delay in the receipt of amended allotments have come under notice, and in such instances steps have been taken to ascertain the cause. A further direction to expedite the transmission of allotments has been issued to the Australian Imperial Force Headquarters abroad. It has been noted from communications received by the Department that some allottees are under the impression that an allotment is automatically increased on promotion of a member of the Australian Imperial Force. Such is not the case, though the Chief Paymaster takes steps to see that higher allotments to dependants are made by the soldiers. After an amended allotment has been completed, it is necessary that it should be forwarded to the Chief Paymaster, London, or the Staff Paymaster, Cairo, before it can be authorized for payment and forwarded to Australia. It therefore follows that dependants generally receive from a soldier information of the alteration of the rate before the allotment form arrives. The period of transmission will be reduced to the minimum.

#### LOCATION AND MINISTERS

##### Mr BOYD:

-- Will the Minister for Works and Railways, when he issues the little publication by  **Mr. Knibbs,**  or the publication issued from the Department itself, see that there is contained therein the addresses of the different Government departmental buildings in the city, with the names of the controlling Ministers? There have been so many changes in these respects that it is now almost impossible to find a Department or a Minister. 

##### Mr GROOM:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Works and Railways &middot; DARLING DOWNS, QUEENSLAND &middot; NAT</small>

-- The honorable member was good enough to intimate that he intended to ask this question, and I can now inform him that I shall take steps to have his wishes complied with.

#### WORKMEN'S HOUSES AT. LITHGOW

##### Mr NICHOLLS:<br><small class="text-muted">MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Is it the intention of the Government to commence the housing system which was suggested some time ago for Lithgow ? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- Yes. Steps to that end have already been taken, and the matter is in progress. Land has been acquired and designs are being prepared,' and when. I vacated the office of Minister for Works and Railways the work had advanced to a satisfactory stage.

### SUPPLY BILL MINISTERIAL INTENTION

##### Mr HIGGS:

-- If it is not the intention of the Government to close down Parliament at an early date, what is the object in introducing a three months' Supply Bill to cover expenditure to the end of the financial year? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I do not presume to teach the honorable member the business of finance, for he has been Treasurer longer than I, and knows the advantage in war time of having ample supply. The question raised can, I think, be discussed when the Bill is before us.
