### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-4-0}
#### AUSTRALAN IMPERIAL FORCE

Deserters' Dependants - Mothers of Ex-nuptial Children. 

##### Mr MATHEWS:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE PORTS, VICTORIA</small>

-- Has the Acting Prime Minister  **(Mr. Watt)**  any information to give us as to the intention of the Government with regard to paying their allowance to the dependants of soldiers who have deserted, and with regard to placing the mothers of ex-nuptial children on the same footing as widowed mothers? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; BALACLAVA, VICTORIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- About the matter last mentioned I have no information to give at present; the matter first mentioned is still the subject of negotiation between this Government and the Government of Victoria.

#### PRICE OF MEAT

##### Mr TUDOR:<br><small class="text-muted">YARRA, VICTORIA</small>

-- I would like to ask the Acting Prime Minister  **(Mr. Watt),**  or the Minister in charge of price fixing, whether the Government can make any announcement as to the increase in the price of meat they have decided upon at the request of the squatters and butchers? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- It is not usual for my honorable friend to couch a question in such discourteous language. I suggest that, on second thoughts, and on reflection, he should give notice of the question to the Minister in charge of price fixing.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-6-0}
#### TARIFF

##### Mr HIGGS:<br><small class="text-muted">CAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- In view of the arrangements which are being made in regard to Australian raw products, is it the intention of the Government to introduce at once a scientific Protectionist Tariff designed to protect Australian secondary industries? If the Government do not propose to at once amend the Australian Customs Tariff in such a manner as to give adequate protection to Australian industries, do they propose to make any such amendment during the life of the present Parliament? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I know that the honorable member's question deals with a very important matter, but it is hardly of a character that may be labelled urgent. If the honorable member will give notice of his question, it will be considered.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-8-0}
#### WHEAT POOL

##### Mr RODGERS:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; LP; NAT from 1917</small>

-- Varying statements are made by Federal Ministers, and State Ministers, and also occasionally by Comptrollers in regard to the operation of the Wheat Pool, some of which have a very damaging effect on the value of wheat scrip. It has recently depreciated from this cause by as much as2½d. per bushel. In view of the great importance of the financial stability of this scrip will the Acting Prime Minister take counsel with the Wheat Board for the purpose of seeing whether an official weekly bulletin can not be issued giving information in regard to the operations of the Pool, not only the information, but also the essential facts upon which it is based, so that the holders of the scrip may form an estimate themselves as to its value? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- The proposition is somewhat novel. I have not heard it suggested that frequent information of an official character should be issued, and I am somewhat doubtful as to the possibility of giving facts that would be of service to the wheat-grower without knowing what is taking place at the other end of the world. Information can be given as to the quantity of wheat stored in Australia, the quantity shipped, and the quantity consumed each week, or each month, but, obviously, for various reasons, in war time, we cannot publish the facts in relation to the difficulty of shipping. It is what prospective buyers at the other end of the world- think of our crop that governs all these matters, and clearly as I am not in a position to give that information I could not publish it. However, I will confer with the members of the Australian Wheat Board as early as practicable in order to see whether it may not be possible to do something in the direction of regular publications in order to stabilize the fluctuating wheat scrip.

### QUESTION

#### FRENCH MISSION

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">MARIBYRNONG, VICTORIA</small>

-- Is it the intention of the visiting French Mission to be in 

Melbourne next weekwhenthe Royal AgriculturalShow will be held? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- From information I have received I am inclined to think that the French Mission cannot arrive in Melbourne at so early a date. In order to arrange for the maximum amount of sightseeing of a vital kind within the shortest possible time, the itinerary of the Mission was arranged some time in advance of its arrival, and as it came toSydney first, it was thought advisable that Queensland should be visited before the weather became too hot. The Mission will come down to Melbourne in due course, and is' timed to arrive here about 14th October next. It will then proceed to Tasmania, and return to Melbourne in time to co-ordinate with another great festival which is held here in November.

### QUESTION

#### SOVIETS' REPRESENTATION IN AUSTRALIA

##### Mr KELLY:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the Acting Prime Minister received any official confirmation of the news published in the press that theSoviets in Russia have declared war against the British Empire? Further, has the special representation of these Soviets in Australia been terminated since this declaration of war? 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- We have no official information of the kind referred to by the honorable member. Beyond that I do not care to say anything at the present time.

#### PRIME MINISTER

##### Mr CONSIDINE:<br><small class="text-muted">BARRIER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the Acting Prime Minister any official information in regard to the cabled statements that there is a movement on foot to retain the services of the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Hughes)**  in England? If so, is it the intention of the Government toco-operate with that part of the Empire in order to secure the achievement of such a desirable state of affairs?

Instead of the commercial banks being required to pay to the Commonwealth Bank- instanter, on the instalment date, the amounts which they have collected in respect of their clients' subscriptions, there will be allowed a period over which that transfer will" extend. In view of the number of days on which instalments are receivable there will be practically a gradual but continuous transfer, as required, from the commercial banks to the Commonwealth Bank.

##### Mr GREGORY:

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. Is it a fact that applications for discharge made by members of the Australian Imperial Force who enlisted in 1914, and have been continuously at the Front, have been refused? 
1. If so, does the Minister consider that it is just to these men to refuse their applications while, it is alleged, there are many persons employed in the Defence Department eligible for service who have not seen active service? 
2. How many eligible are now employed by the Department in Australia - 

    {: type="a" start="a"}
    0. officers; 
    1. others? 


Mr.WISE. - The answers tothe honorable member's questions are as follow :  - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. Yes; unless the circumstances are of a very distressful, financial, or domestic nature. The reasons, briefly, why these applications could not be approved are: - 

    {: type="1" start="1"}
    0. 1 ) The men enlisted for the period of the war. 
    1. Shortage of . reinforcements. 
    2. As regards those who were returned on furlough, the military authorities overseas relied on their return to service, otherwise it would not be possible to continue the granting of -furlough to their comrades, who had equal claims. 

1. The Minister would have been most happy to have been in a position to grant discharges to all the soldiers who had served continuously since 1914, but, owing to the lack of sufficient reinforcements, and the urgent need for as many men as could be obtained, this has not been possible. There is not a great number of persons employed in the Department eligible for active service, as will be seen from the reply to question No. 3. 
2. Figures distinguishing officers from others are not available, but a return recently furnished showing an analysis of persons engaged in the Department on the 1st July last, is as follows: - 


<graphic href="085331191806195_9_0.jpg"></graphic>


The number of eligibles debarred includes officers, and others with special knowledge required for Defence purposes in Australia. From time to time, permission is given for some of these to enlist where suitable arrangements can be made to replace them, but care has to be taken that the number is not reduced to such an extent as to prejudicially affect the efficiency of the Department. The number of those eligible, but not debarred, has been reduced to a minimum, representing only 5 per cent. of the total employed in the Department. These consist mainly of permanent civilian employees, youths eighteen or nineteen years of age, and persons enlisted for Home Service and retained owing to their special qualifications in accountancy, or other branches of the work of the Department.

{:#subdebate-38-0}
#### MUNITION WORKERS, NAVVIES, AND WAR WORKERS

Maintenance of Dependants

##### Mr MAHONY:

asked the Assistant Minister for Defence,  *upon notice -* 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. What provision, if any, is made by the Government for the maintenance of the dependants of Australian munition workers, navvies, or other war workers who may dic or be incapacitated while on duty in Great Britain? 
1. If no provision is made, will the Minister favorably consider the placing of the dependants of such workers on the same basis as dependants of members of the Australian Imperial Force? 

##### Mr WISE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follow: - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. Munition workers and navvies are not under a contract of service with the Commonwealth Government, but are despatched to Great Britain for employment under the Ministry of Munitions in England upon munition and war work. The Commonwealth Government accepts responsibility for death or incapacity as the result of an accident during the period of the voyage, the men being dealt with under the provisions of the Seamen's Compensation Act, but no responsibility is accepted by the Commonwealth in respect of the men whilst they are in Great Britain. The men, who are,- in the majority of cases, employed with private firms, are, however, in the event  *of*  death or incapacity as the result of accident whilst at work, dealt with under the provisions of local industrial legislation, the firm or Department by which they are employed being responsible, similarly as in the case of all British workmen. 
1. This question has already received careful consideration, and the Government do not propose to extend the operation of the War Pensions Act to the dependants of other than enlisted men.

### MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer &middot; Balaclava &middot; NAT</small>

--  *(By leave).*  - I wish to put before the House the following statement: - 

Recent information concerning the progress of the war has been of the most encouraging character. During the past month rapid and important advances have been made by the Forces of Freedom on the Western Front, justifying the expressions of hope and confidence which have been uttered by the civil and military authorities of Britain and the Allied nations. The Government observes with pride the important part played by our Australian soldiers in these historic movements, and it congratulates the nation on the cheering fact that the casualties amongst our troops have been comparatively light. 

Notwithstanding this grateful change in the military outlook, the Government trusts that there will be noslackening of war efforts amongst the people. 

The prosecution of the war to a victorious end is still the prime duty of Parliament and the nation. 

During the adjournment the man-power problem has received careful attention. 

The arrangements for the voluntary recruiting ballot are nearing completion, and the campaign will be launched in a few days. 

The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy are still in Britain. Their work at the War Cabinet and the Empire Conference has been of the utmost consequence to the future of the Commonwealth. They are at present endeavouring to remove the great and increasing difficulties surrounding the sale and shipment of our products, upon which so much depends for the preservation of our prosperity. 

The members of the National French Mission, headed by General Pau, have arrived in Australia, and are the welcome guests of the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. 

Everywhere they are received with popular enthusiasm, and the Government trusts that the visit will cement enduring ties between the people of this country and the great Republic of France. 

It is not proposed at this stage to describe the work of administration since 

Parliament rose. That will be outlined in the Budget, which will be presented next week. 

But the Government desires to record its pleasure at the success which has attended its efforts to secure the return on furlough of the veteran Australian troops who embarked for service in 1914. 

It is the intention of the Government to make the present session essentially a business one. To that end Amending Standing Orders will be brought down, which, if adopted, will substantially expedite public business. 

The Government invites the cooperation of honorable members in the consideration and passage of important legislative measures between now and the end of the year. 

Our growing financial burdens arising out of the war will necessitate additional taxation. Proposals for raising the revenue required will be described and submitted in theFinancial Statement. 

In fulfilment of the repatriation policy of the Government, a Bill to provide for the housing of returned soldiers will be introduced. 

An extensive Electoral Bill will also be brought in, which will co-ordinate the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth and the States, consolidate the many existing Electoral Acts, provide for preferential voting for the election of members to the House of Representatives, restore a modified form of postal voting, and remedy other defects shown by experience to exist in the present electoral machinery. 

A Bill making provision for the statutory management of the Government line of steamers will be introduced. 

To secure equitable contributions by the people to the war loans, in accordance with their means, a measure has been framed, and will be presented for consideration. 

Price fixing has now assumed considerable proportions, and it is felt that the time has arrived to place this upon a more satisfactory basis during the war than that of a War Precautions regulation. Steps having that end in view will accordingly be taken. 

To establish conditions essential to the conduct of continuous and economical operation of shipbuilding, the Government entered into agreements with a number of industrial unions. A Bill will be introduced to give effect to the promise made to the Conference, and to the provisions of the agreements with the unions. 

Action has. been taken for the creation of an Institute of Science and Industry. A Bill will be submitted to give effect to this scheme. The intention is to secure full co-operation between the Commonwealth and States in this important matter. 

Legislation will be introduced providing for the adequate control of waters in the vicinity of Naval Establishments, Arsenals, Dockyards, &amp;c. 

A measure to encourage the manufacture of black steel sheets and galvanized sheets in the Commonwealth has also been framed. 

Other measures ready for your consideration are Bills to amend the Defence Act, the Naval Defence Act, the Maternity Allowance Act, the Service and Execution of Process Act, as well as Bills for the purpose of administrative amendments to the Customs Act, the Distillation Act, the Excise Act, and the Spirits Act. These, with proposals for which leave to introduce has already been given, will be the subjects of deliberation before Parliament again rises. 

I move - 

  >That the paper bc printed. 

##### Mr TUDOR:<br><small class="text-muted">Yarra</small>

.- In accordance with the custom that has prevailed from the beginning, when statements like that which we have just heard, setting out the Ministerial programme for what is practically a session, have been made, I move - 

  >That the debate be now adjourned. 

##### Mr WATT:<br><small class="text-muted">Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer &middot; Balaclava &middot; NAT</small>

.- I desire, for personal reasons, to oblige the honorable gentleman, and I do not wish to impale on the horns ofduty any other honorable member opposite ; but the statement was so simple, non-contentious and non -rhetorical, that I hoped that honorable members might agree to it right away. I trust that if the debate be adjourned, honorable members will see that our business is advanced a stage tomorrow. 

Motion agreed to; debate adjourned. 

House adjourned at 3.33 p.m.
