{:#subdebate-0-0}
#### NOTICE OF CENSURE MOTION

##### Mr CHARLTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Hunter</small>

:.- I desire to give notice that to-morrowI shall move - 

  >That the Government he severely censured for referring its sugar transactions to the Public Accounts Committee before disposing of the amendments moved by the honorable members for . Swan and Bourke, thereby delaying decision on the question of immediately reducing the retail price of sugar.

### NOTICE OF WANT OF CONFIDENCE MOTION

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">COWPER, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; FSU; CP from 1920</small>

-- I desire to give notice that to-morrow I shall move - 

  >That, in view, of the failure of the Government to supply information regarding its dealings in sugar and the separate balance-sheets, as promised for 9th August, to enable this House to promptly determine the proper reduction in the price of sugar, the Government no longer possesses the confidence of this House.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-2-0}
#### SUGAR CONTROL

##### Mr HIGGS:<br><small class="text-muted">CAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- It seems that both the Labour party and the Country party  axe  anxious to' destroy the sugar agreement. I  desire  to ask the Prime Minister whether he has seen in to-day's issue of the Melbourne  *Age*  a statement by  **Mr. J.**  W. Aspinall, secretary of the Metropolitan and District Fruit-growers Association, to the effect that- 

##### Mr Brennan:

--  I rise to order. Haying had on many occasions the advantage of a ruling by you,  **Mr. Speaker,**  that a question to a Minister may not be founded on a newspaper statement, I submit that the question which the honorable member for Capricornia seeksto address 'to the Prime Minister is out of order. 

##### Mr SPEAKER (Hon Sir Elliot Johnson:<br><small class="text-muted">LANG, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

--  I did not understand the honorable member to say that he was basing his question on a newspaper statement, but on a statement made by a person  whose name he mentioned. A question founded on a statement by a newspaper may be asked if the questioner takes responsibility for its accuracy. 

##### Mr HIGGS:

-- I take full responsibility for the truth of the report that  **Mr. Aspinall**  made a statement to the effect that when the farmer got £19 per ton out of the £56 per ton charged for sugar there remained j£37 to account for. " First of all,"  **Mr. Aspinall**  said, " the miller gets his cut, then the refiner, then the wholesale distributer, then the retail grocer, and last, but not least, the Federal Government." Adopting the language used by  **Mr. Aspinall,**  I desire to ask the Prime Minister what " out " does the Federal Government get out of the sugar business? 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; BENDIGO, VICTORIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- All these notices of motions and questions gravitate around this one matter. The Government does not get anything out of the sugar business except abuse and vilification. Of that it gets more than its fair share; of money it gets nothing.

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follow : - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. It is not, and has not been, the practice to apply a dictation test to immigrants from Southern Europe, but in a limited number of cases it has been deemed advisable to do so. 
1. Tlie only instances in which the test has been applied to Southern Europeans are the following: - to one Italian (arriving from Ceylon) in 1913, to a number of Maltese (arriving from Malta by one vessel) in 1916, and to one Italian (arriving from Italy) in 1922. 
2. Yes. In the case of the Southern Europeans tested all were restricted, in the first place, hut practically all were subsequently allowed to land.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-7-0}
#### OLD-AGE PENSIONS

PENSIONERS in Dunwich Asylum. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

asked the Treasurer,  *upon notice -* 

Do old-age pension citizens resident in Dunwich Asylum, Brisbane, receive the same treatment as pensioners in regard to money payments as those who are patients in hospitals; if not, what are the reasons? 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; FLINDERS, VICTORIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- The answer to the honorable member's questions are as follow: 

Every pensioner resident in Dunwich or other Benevolent Asylum receives a pension of 2s. per week for his own personal use. In addition, the Commonwealth pays the institution 10s. fid. per week for his maintenance. When a pensioner becomes an inmate of a hospital, his pennon must be suspended in accordance with section 45 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. If the pensioner is discharged within twenty-eight days, he is paid the full pension for that period." If he is an inmate for more than twenty-eight days, he is paid twenty-eight days' pension on discharge. No payment is made for the maintenance of tlie pensioner during the twenty-eight days in respect of which he receives pension, but thereafter, until he is discharged, the Commonwealth pays 10s. fid. per week towards his maintenance in the hospital. The reason for the difference is that pensioners in benevolent asylums are usually permanent inmates, while those in hospitals stay there for only short periods. It is thought proper that on discharge the latter should receive full pension in respect of twentyeight days spent in the institution, so that they may have extra comforts during convalescence.

##### Mr POYNTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Postmaster-General &middot; GREY, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- On the 3rd instant the honorable member for Cowper  **(Dr. Earle Page)**  asked me the following questions : -

I promised that the information would be obtained, and now furnish the following replies: - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. The New Telegraph and Telephone Works Estimates for 1916-17, as presented to the Treasury, amounted to £1, 142,000,but only £647,000 was made available. The value of material and equipment (for some of which tenders had been received) included in the foregoing was approximately £912,000, which had to be reduced to approximately £520,000. 
1. See No. 1. 
2. Based upon current market rates, the present price of the some materials would average50 per cent, higher, or, say, £1,368,000 and £780,000 respectively. The actual increase in the case of automatic equipment is about 100 per cent

### INCOME TAX

Refund of Over-payments. 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- Yesterday the honor  able member for Wilmot asked whether it was the custom of the Taxation Department, when taxpayers inadvertently overstated their income, to allow such persons to pay the full . amount. I see in reports in the newspapers this morning a suggestion that since I became Treasurer an alteration has in some way been made in regard to such cases of overpayment. I wish to correct that impression, and to state to the House that the officers of the Taxation Department have always worked under definite instructions from the Commissioner that their duty is to rectify all errors in taxpayers' returns, whether for or against the revenue.

### PERSONAL EXPLANATION

##### Mr MAXWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">FAWKNER, VICTORIA</small>

-- Idesire to make a personal 'explanation. Yesterday I recorded a vote in favour of the adjournment of the debate on the sugar question moved  by  one of the Ministers, and my consistency in so doing has been called in question by one of our daily newspapers this morning. On the previous day of sitting I voted for an amendment, moved  by  the . honorable member for Hunter  **(Mr. Charlton),**  that the price of sugar be reduced to  4½d.  per  lb.,  andI did  so as a  protest against the failure of the Government to supply  us  with such figures as would enable us to say whether or not such reduction may  be  made.In regard to  my  vote yesterday for the adjournment of the debate, I desire to say that I gave it on the- assurance of the Minister for Trade and Customs  **(Mr. Rodgers)**  that the figures for which I have been asking would be supplied to-day. It was on that distinct assurance that I supported the motion for the adjournment; otherwise I should have voted against it.
