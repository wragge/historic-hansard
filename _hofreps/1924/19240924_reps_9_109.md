#### EXPORTERS OF BUTTER

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">MARIBYRNONG, VICTORIA</small>

-- I wish to ask the Prime Minister a questionwith reference to the registration of exporters of butter. There are some persons who buy direct from the butter factories, and, so far as the factories are concerned, the transaction ends there. These persons havein  the past exported butter to agents in London. I wish to know whether, under the bill passed in this House last night, it will be possible for them to be registered as butter exporters. 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for External Affairs &middot; FLINDERS, VICTORIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- Under the provisions of the bill which passed this House last night, licences have to be obtained for the export of butter. These licences will be issued subject to the terms and conditions laid down by the Control Board. It will be possible for any one to obtain an export licence on the terms and conditions laid down. There is nothing in the bill to prevent the persons to whomthe honorable member has referred from obtaining licences to export butter.

#### COMPENSATION TO WATERSIDE WORKERS

##### Mr ANSTEY:<br><small class="text-muted">BOURKE, VICTORIA</small>

-- Last week the honorable member for Dalley (Mr.Mahony) asked the Prime Minister a question in connexion with a number of gentlemen in Sydney who have been given out of the public purse a donation of £5,000. The Prime Minister, in answering the question, stated that the gentlemen referred to had rendered great patriotic services in the hour tff our national crisis. I am informed that the workmen to whom the Government has given £5,000, after the time they were thrown out of work on the waterfront,were employed through the Shipping . Bureau by fourteen shipping companies and one stevedoring company, and received in wages £1 13s. 6d. per week less than the arbitration award rate. The fourteen shipping companies and the stevedoring company, in giving these workmen employment in this way, made a profit of. £30,000. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member is exceeding the limits of a question. He is giving information, not asking for it, which is the purpose of a question. 

##### Mr ANSTEY:

-- The request for the information I am seeking arises out of the information I have given. If the facts are as I have stated them, why should not the companies, who reaped £30,000 from the cheap labour of these men, pay them compensation for theirloss of employment ? Why should the country have to pay it? 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- Thehonorable gentleman has given the House certain information the correctness or otherwise of which I have no means at the moment of ascer taining. If he will put the information he has given, and his question also, on the notice-paper,I shall ascertain the facts for him.

#### KALGOORLIE TO FREMANTLE RAILWAY

Construction on Standard Gauge. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">SWAN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- In view of the agreement made between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland for the construction of a certain railway, would the Government be prepared to execute a similar agreement with the Government of Western Australia, if so desired, to construct a railway from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle on the standard gauge.? 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- At the conference of Premiers which was held in May, 1923, this whole question was discussed, and three stages of the unification scheme were laid down. It was decided by the commission appointed to deal with the matter that the first step taken should be the construction of a standard-gauge line from Kyogle to Brisbane, and afterwards the construction of such lines from Port Augusta to Salisbury, just outside Adelaide, and from Kalgoorlie to Perth. It is contemplated that these three stages towards unification shall be carried out as and when they are agreed to. The Commonwealth Government would be prepared to discuss with the Government of Western Australia the construction of the Western Australian line, as it was considered at the conference held twelve months ago.

#### SOUVENIRS OF H.M.A.S. AUSTRALIA

##### Mr A GREEN:<br><small class="text-muted">KALGOORLIE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- Is the Minister for Defence aware that the souvenirs of H.M.A.S.  *Australia,*  promised to local bodies that applied for them several weeks ago, have not yet been delivered ? Can the honorable gentleman inform the House when they are likely to be forwarded to those who have applied for them ? 

##### Mr BOWDEN:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Defence &middot; PARRAMATTA, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; NAT</small>

-- Arrangements are being made to have the State Governments undertake the distribution of the souvenirs. Some of the State Governments have communicated their willingness to do this, and souvenirs have been sent to them for the purpose. We are awaiting replies on the matter from other State Governments.

#### IMPORTATION AND CENSORSHIP OF PICTURE FILMS

##### Mr FENTON:

-- The Minister for Trade and Customs will remember that some two or three weeks ago questions were put to him by a number of honorable members, including myself, in connexion with the importation and censorship of picture films. Is the honorable gentleman in a position to give the House any information on the subject? 

##### Mr PRATTEN:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; MARTIN, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; NAT</small>

-- I have a statement here in reply to questions by a number of honorable members on this matter, and with the permission of the House I shall read it. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I assume that the honorable member proposes to make the statement in the form of an answer to the question which has been asked him. If so, permission to make it is not necessary. 

##### Mr PRATTEN:

-- I take the opportunity of replying to questions that were asked me on this matter by the honorable member for Perth  **(Mr. Mann),**  the honorable member for Darling  **(Mr. Blakeley),**  the honorable member for Maribyrnong  **(Mr. Fenton),**  the honorable member for New England  **(Mr. Thompson),**  and the honorable member for Bass  **(Mr. Jackson).**  There is no distinct act of Parliament authorizing a censorship of films. The present censorship derives its authority from section 52  *g*  of the Customs Act, which is the section giving authority to prohibit the importation of goods. Proclamations have been issued under the Customs Act prohibiting the importation of films and advertising matter except under certain conditions, and with the consent of the Minister. The conditions governing importation are contained' in regulations issued under the Customs Act. These regulations provide for,  *inter alia,*  the following, matters: - (a) the establishment of Commonwealth film censorship;  *(b)*  registration of films; (c) examination of applications;  *(d)*  bars to registration. The regulations state, that, no film shall be registered which, in the opinion of a censor, is: -  *(a)*  blasphemous, indecent, or obscene; (&amp;) is likely to be injurious to morality or to encourage or incite to crime; (c) is likely to be offensive to .the people of any friendly nation;  *(d)*  depicts any matter, the exhibition of which is undesirable in the public interest. The Commonwealth Film Censorship has set up certain standards for the examination of films in connexion with the above-mentioned regulations. A film refused registration by the censorship automatically becomes a prohibited import under the Customs Act. The censorship, however, may itself  delete objectionable matter in a film and render it harmless; or it may give to an importer himself the opportunity of reconstructing a rejected film. This reconstruction generally takes the form of altering the story, or of making extensive eliminations. The censorship reserves the right to reject a reconstructed film if it is not satisfied with the alterations made- by the importer. Those remarks will serve to explain briefly the method at present being adopted by the Film Censorship. The question of the advertising of films is very closely related to the censorship of films. The censorship has,, of course, authority over imported advertising matter in the shape of posters and the like, and instructions have already been issued to the censor that in addition to the general censorship of films he must also judge them by the imported advertising. It often happens that a film reasonably harmless in itself is advertised as containing some salacious or at least objectionable matter. In such cases the censor will now also judge a film by the advertising matter, i.e., he will judge the film according to the standard set up by its manufacturer or exporter. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Government has no authority over newspaper advertising of films or locally-printed advertising matter, and criticism often arises from a newspaper advertisement of a certain film. It has often happened that matter eliminated by the censorship from the imported advertising matter has been used by either the importer or an exhibitor in connexion with newspaper advertising of the film or in locallyproduced advertising matter. This is an aspect of the question to which I intend to give very serious consideration, because such advertising is distinctly unfair both to the censorship and the public. Any offender in future in this respect will receive no consideration whatever from the department. Extreme measures will be used against any importer, or his showing agent, who thus flouts the decision of the department, and I hope to have the support of honorable members in maintaining the authority of their censor. This opportunity is taken of notifying those interested in the -importation of films that where1 any instance is brought under my notice .of- the use of an advertisement prohibited by .the censor, or the use in an -advertisement of any -direct or indirect reference to any matter deleted by the censor from a picture, the importer will, in addition to any other action taken against him, have the concession of reconstruction of his future importations withdrawn. Film advertisement can most readily and surely be controlled by the -owners of films, and they will be held responsible for the manner of advertising -them, and- must protect themselves when drawing up their contracts for sale or leasing. It is regretted that the State Governments so far have unfavorably considered the proposal to transfer to the Commonwealth authority over the local advertising of films. Attention will be given to what is being done regarding the -production of Australian films here. There is obviously a small maf ket here for films of our own production, but if suitable films for Australian people can be made here,  *L*  think some .measure of encouragement - even if only indirectly - might be given. .So far as British films are concerned, it might be possible to adopt some prohibitory measures respecting importations -of films from sources other than within the Empire, but the situation is a little difficult on account of the hold possessed by American films in the United Kingdom, where the bulk of British films is produced. This question will be carefully examined. In the United Kingdom certain films are passed as fit for exhibition to adults only. New Zealand is also moving in this direction, and it is proposed to carefully watch film legislation, and also the question of the encouragement of Australian and British films, in view of the undoubted propagandist nature of certain American films.  It  may be found necessary ;to instruct the censorship to adopt a stricter interpretation of the regulations -and of its standards. Possibly the privilege of reconstruction just recently curtailed will be further restricted. The censorship has in recent weeks refused to grant this privilege in three instances. Complaints have also been made that .there are one or more combines of film distributors, and that because of this it is impossible to show in the picture theatres of Australia even the pictures showing Australian scenes and industries that were -recently exhibited in the Queen's -Hall. If this be true it is intolerable that .such a position should exist, precluding our own people in our own country from having some knowledge of our own land. An attempt will he made to impose a still stricter censorship of films dealing with the lurid side of life, in which infidelity, murder, intrigue, and shooting play so prominent a part. A determined effort will also be made to restrict any attempt to impose upon our people objectionable peculiarities  and characteristics of other nations. I propose to take steps to revise immediately the existing regulations in order to give' the censorship firmer control over some of the matters I have referred to. For example, any film objectionable to the sentiments of the people of the British Empire will be treated as a prohibited import. Any film produced in Australia which is likely to be detrimental to the interests of the Commonwealth will be refused export. In the past the censorship has worked under very great difficulties, but T feel that honorable members generally will support me in all reasonable efforts that are taken to strengthen the Commonwealth Film Censorship control.

#### PORT AUGUSTA TO HAY RAILWAY

##### Mr MANNING:<br><small class="text-muted">MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Since the report was received recommending for military purposes the construction of a railway from Hay to Port Augusta, the whole situation has altered. The New South Wales Government is at present constructing the line to Broken Hill, and has completed a southern line connexion from Narrandera, through Leeton to 'Griffith, and from there to Hillston. An agreement has also been made between the New South Wales and Victorian Governments for opening up with railway extensions from Victoria practically the whole of the country suitable for agriculture which was originally proposed to be served by the suggested line from Port Augusta to Hay. In view of these facts, will the Government undertake not to enter into any arrangement to build the suggested line from Port Augusta to Hay until the whole matter of the rival routes has been fully inquired into by the Public Works 'Committee ? 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- All the facts mentioned by the honorable member, including railway extensions from Victoria into New South Wales, and the intended completion of the line to Broken Hill by the New South Wales Government, were considered at the Premiers' Conferencelast year. No arrangement has been made with any state to build the Port Augusta to Hay railway, and no action is contemplated by this Government in the near future.
