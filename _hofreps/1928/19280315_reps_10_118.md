### CANADIAN EECIPEOCAL TARIFF

Mr.RODGERS. - Has the Prime Minister seen the press reports of frequent objections by a section of the Canadian people to certain phases of the reciprocal trade treaty between Australia and Canada? Will the right honorable gentleman take a favorable opportunity while the Tariff Bill is before another place, to give full consideration to Canadian interests, particularly in regard to the lumber trade ? 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I have from time to time read in the press of the discussions in Canada in regard to the reciprocal treaty made with Australia a few years ago. Those discussions seem to be merely the ordinary political controversies that fiscal matters arouse in any country. The Tariff Bill which is now  before another  place does not provide an opportunity for readjusting our trade relations with Canada, as they are governed entirely by a reciprocal treaty. Any alteration must be by a revision of the Treaty.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-14-0}
#### TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS EARNED ABROAD

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">SWAN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Last year I moved an amendment to the Income, Tax Assessment Bill, with a view to having income derived from investments outside Australia brought within the provisions of the Income Tax Act. The Prime Minister then said that inquiries would be made to ascertain what the effect of such an amendment would be. I should like to 'know whether any action has been taken, and. whether there is a possibility of an amendment of that nature being incorporated in . the Act during this session ? 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- In accordance with the promise that I gave to the House when, the amendment was moved by the honorable member, the matter was immediately taken into consideration, and it has occupied the attention of the Commissioner for Taxation and his officers ever since. The subject is complicated and requires considerable investigation. Inquiries are not yet complete, but I anticipate that they will be concluded in  the near future. The Government intends to take all the facts into consideration and to announce to the House, as early as possible, whether any action is to be taken.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-15-0}
#### ABRAHAMS PROSECUTIONS

##### Mr ANSTEY:<br><small class="text-muted">BOURKE, VICTORIA</small>

-- What security does the Attorney-General hold for the payment by the Abrahams brothers of additional donations amounting to £300,000, and on what dates are they to be paid ? 

 Mi-. LATHAM.- There are no additional donations in any sense whatever to be obtained from the Abrahams brothers. The sum of £500,000  -  not £300,000, as the honorable member has stated - is smaller that that which the Commissioner of Taxation would have been able to charge without appealing to any court at all. The securities which are held relate, I understand, to land in various parts of the Commonwealth and perhaps to other forms of property; but, without, notice, I am unable to state precisely what they are. 

##### Mr ANSTEY:

-- I wish to draw the Attorney-General's attention to the fact that he has overlooked my question respecting the dates when the donations are to be made. 

##### Mr LATHAM:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I propose later this afternoon to make available to honorable members the terms of the agreement between the Commissioner and the Abrahams brothers, and from it any honorable member will be able to ascertain the dates. I have not in my mind at the moment what those dates are.

### BREACHES OF WIRELESS REGULATIONS

{:#subdebate-16-0}
#### Formal Motion of Adjournment

##### Mr SPEAKER (Hon Sir Littleton Groom:<br><small class="text-muted">DARLING DOWNS, QUEENSLAND</small>

--  I have received an intimation from, the honorable member for Werriwa  **(Mr. Lazzarini)**  that he desires to move the adjournment of the House this afternoon for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, " The unjust and differential treatment meted out to Australian citizens for alleged breaches of wireless regulations." 


 *Five honorable members having risen in their places,* 


Question proposed. 

##### Mr LAZZARINI:<br><small class="text-muted">Werriwa</small>

.- I have taken this course in regard to summonses that have been- issued against certain persons in my electorate for breaches of the wireless regulations, because it is the only way in which I can ventilate this matter on the floor of Parliament, unless its discussion is delayed until the Estimates are before us, that is, some months ahead. I shall put the position briefly. I am making two charges against the Postmaster-General's Department. The first is . that it has treated certain persons with undue harshness, and I shall give one specific case as an indication of many others. The second is that one person at least was summoned on the same day that a more serious offence against the regulations was disregarded by the PostmasterGeneral's Department. The person summoned was  **Mr. Frank**  Matthews, of Scarborough, and he had committed no serious breach of the regulations at all. A wireless instrument was installed  in his home, and he was summoned for using it without a licence. The facts are that the instrument was sent from Sydney and arrived at Scarborough by the 4.30 p.m. train on the .1st December last. That night it was partly erected by the radio dealer, and was completed and operated for about two or two' and a half hours on the night of the 2nd. The dealer then took the instrument out of the house - it was still his property - to give a demonstration at Austinmere on the Sunday to one or two prospective customers. He returned with the instrument on Monday night, the 5th December, and permanently installed it at  **Mr. Matthews'**  home. I understand that the regulations allow the radio dealer three clear days during which to install a wireless set and to test it, before it is placed in the possession of the purchaser. Then, of course, the purchaser is responsible for taking out a licence.  **Mr. Matthews**  told the radio dealer that he would pay for the set the next clay, and would also take out a licence. He had to leave his home at 6.30 a.m. on the Tuesday morning in order to be at the face of the mine where he was employed at 7 o'clock. No post office is open at that early hour, and it  wa3,  therefore, impossible for him to get his licence, before he went to his work on the Tuesday, when his responsibility for the set actually began. While he was at work that day two men called at the house of  **Mrs. Jones,**  where he boards. The men asked if  **Mr. Matthews**  had a licence 'for his radio set, and  **Mrs. Jones**  replied that she thought he' had not. The men said that they would call back later to see  **Mr. Matthews.**  That afternoon  **Mr. Matthews**  drove in his motor car to the post office, about l£ miles distant, took out a licence, and also paid the radio dealer for the machine. When he returned home, the men saw him and practically insulted him by insinuating that if they had not called to see him that morning he would have operated the set without a licence. After a few moments' further conversation, during which he was told that he would receive a summons from the police, the men went away.  **Mr. Matthews**  communicated with me, and I addressed a letter on the matter to the Postmaster-General, from whom I received an ordinary routine reply, acknowledging receipt of the letter, and stating that inquiries would be made into the case. I received a further letter from  **Mr. Matthews,**  stating that he had been informed that the summons would be delivered on the Wednesday. I communicated by telephone with the wireless authorities, and was informed, five days after my writing to the PostmasterGeneral, that they were waiting for a reply from the Minister as to what action should be taken. I then received from  **Mr. Matthews**  an extract from the  *South Coast Times,*  stating that he had appeared before the court, and had been fined for breach of the wireless regulations. I may point out that unjust treatment of the owners of radio sets, such as. has been meted out to  **Mr. Matthews,**  is militating seriously against the increased use of wireless telegraphy. As a matter of fact, I have seen a statement by the Postmaster-General to that effect. I shall refer in a few moments to a minute written by the Minister, giving the instruction that the summons against  **Mr. Matthews**  be withdrawn. Nevertheless, inspectors took the matter to the court. Although the circumstances of the case had been explained to them, as I have outlined them to the House, the inspectors endeavoured to prove to the court that  **Mr. Matthews**  had the instrument in his- house and had used it without a licence from the 1st December.  **Mr. Matthews,**  during his examination in court, compelled one of the inspectors to admit that there had been a misunderstanding, and that he had only committed a breach of the regulations - virtually only a technical breach - from the Tuesday morning. There had been some glaring breaches of the regulations in the neighbourhood of "Wollongong, where persons had used, .their sets for weeks without a licence." With offenders of that description, I have no sympathy. The magistrate had threatened to be severe on the defendants if further similar cases were brought before him, and, in giving his judgment against  **Mr. Matthews,**  he had in mind his promise to inflict severe penalties in future. After five or six men had been fined the magistrate, according' to a newspaper report, said - 

  >He was prompted to say this, evidently in view of the fact that, whereas the regulations allow six days in which to have a set registered, two of the defendants- 


 **Mr. Matthews** and a man at Wollongong  had been pumiced upon on the sixth day. 

In view of  **Mr. Matthews's**  explanation that he had only come under the regulations on the Tuesday morning, or, at the earliest, on Monday night, the inspectors had no right to offer him a gratuitous insult by saying that, but for their inquiries, he would not have obtained his licence at all, and that he secured it only 


 **Mr.** 
 *Lazzarini* i to avoid punishment.  **Mr. Matthews**  is an exemplary citizen, and is known and respected throughout the community in which he lives. He could obtain credit, not for £2  *or*  £3, but for hundreds of pounds, from any of the business people on the coast. For him to have been haled before the court, treated as a rogue, and charged practically with trying to cheat the department out of its licence-fee, is too much. When I put the case before the Postmaster-General, explaining that I had received a letter giving particulars o' the circumstances, I said that it was a case of harsh and unjust treatment. I received a letter, in reply, stating that the Minister had inquired into the matter, and had made a note that the summons should be withdrawn, but that the information had not been sent on to the wireless inspectors. Owing to an oversight the minute had remained in the Minister's office, and that was given as the reason why  **Mr. Matthews**  had been brought before the court. I told the Minister that  **Mr. Matthews**  should, at least, be reimbursed to the extent of the amount of his fine and the value of the time lost from his employment. A statement to that effect in the press would have exonerated him. Nothing was done. A letter was received stating that, after all, the man had been convicted in the court. He was a man who,' as I have said, worked in the mines for his living, and who had to leave his home at 6.20 each morning to get to his place of employment. There was another man to whom the inspectors went the same morning. He was not at home, and they asked his wife whether his instrument was licensed. 

##### Mr Gibson:

--  What was his name? 

##### Mr LAZZARINI:

-- I shall give his name presently. He was himself just as much incensed about the treatment meted out to Matthews as I am. When questioned by the inspectors his wife said that she did not know whether the set was licensed. The .inspectors then told her that they would return later and interview her husband. I do not wish any one. to think that this man was dishonest. He had made only a technical  omission. He was not robbing the PostmasterGeneral's Department, nor had he evaded payment of his licence fee any more than Matthews had. The fact remained, however, that they represented two different classes of society, and they were treated in different ways. The second man went to the post office and obtained his licence in the same way as Matthews did. 

##### Mr Gibson:

-- The honorable member might let us have his name. 

##### Mr LAZZARINI:

-- His name escapes me for the time being, but I can easily obtain it. He is the manager of the mine; the other man a worker in the mine. When he arrived home his wife told him that the inspectors had called, whereupon he went to the post office and obtained his licence. The inspectors called again, and he informed them that he had obtained the licence; They said, " You are lucky ; you got it just in time." 

##### Mr Gibson:

-- How long had he had his set? 

##### Mr LAZZARINI:

-- He had obtained his set before Matthews got his, and had been using it all the time. If these inspectors are going about the country doing their job in this way, they are not entitled to hold the positions they do. In my electorate the Postmaster-General's Department has been administered more for political purposes than to meet the needs of the people. I deprecate the action of the inspectors in jumping on these men for such technical breaches of the wireless regulation, particularly in country districts. The PostmasterGeneral is a member of the Country party, the policy of which is supposed to be to give all possible facilities to the people in the country, and to encourage the development of country centres. The action of which I have spoken militates very greatly against the development of wireless in country districts. I have communicated examples of unfair treatment to the Minister. I have made no recommendation whatever, but simply sent on the letters embodying the complaints, as any member of Parliament is bound to do. I have never pleaded any case in which a man had committed a breach for which it was right he should pay the penalty. If the Postmaster-General has officers moving around the country with instructions to obtain convictions at any cost, like an enthusiastic policeman looking for his next stripe, then he should treat all the people alike; the same treatment should be meted out whether a man works in a mine or manages it. I hope the fact that I have ventilated this case will prevent future examples of favoritism, and that the Postmaster-General will see that his officers investigate cases of this kind on their merits. 

##### Mr Brennan:

-- Were they the same inspectors who called on both the men who have been mentioned? 

##### Mr LAZZARINI:

-- They were the same men, and they called at both places on the same day. 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">HUME, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- One law for the rich and one for the poor. 

##### Mr LAZZARINI:

-- I do hot wish the matter to be debated any further, now that I have ventilated it. While it is unlikely that Matthews will obtain any redress, I hope that the mentioning of his case will prevent others of a similar nature occurring in the future. So far as I am concerned, if such cases occur in my electorate, I shall always bring them before the House, and endeavour to see that the people receive justice. 

##### Mr GIBSON:<br><small class="text-muted">PostmasterGeneral &middot; Corangamite &middot; CP</small>

-- This is a matter which might have been brought up on an ordinary motion for the adjournment of the House. I do not think the formal adjournment motion should have been used for the discussion of so trivial a matter ; because the only object, it appears to me, was to bring the case of Matthews before the House. The duty of this Parliament is to make the laws of the country, and to provide the machinery for carrying them, out; if we were to deal with all the individual cases that are brought before the courts, we should be able to" do nothing else. The case of Matthews was quite clearly put by the honorable member. He stated it as it was put to me, but he did not state the. whole case.' I wish to say quite definitely tha.t there is no differential  treatment  whatever in regard to persons with wireless sets without licences. The honorable member mentioned the case of i manager of a mine, a man whose name le does not Know, and he gave no information as to when that man obtained his set. The proof should be given to the House now, and not at a later date. If he had supported his case by stating when the man had obtained his set- 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

-- The honorable gentleman is not putting the case fairly. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-The honorable member is the best judge of how he should present his case.- 

##### Mr GIBSON:

-- It is unfortunate that many members of the general public have a' very elastic conscience in relation to wireless licences, and other matters which affect government revenue. They appear to think that it is not a crime to rob the Government. The honorable member said that by the institution of prosecutions against person's found to be using unlicensed wireless sets the department was militating against the taking out of licences. 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

-- The PostmasterGeneral has admitted it. 

##### Mr GIBSON:

-- I have not. 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

-- It is stated on official files. 

##### Mr GIBSON:

-- I shall show the honorable member that the prosecutions have actually resulted in the receipt of many additional applications. The department is not harsh. Prosecutions only occur when an unanswerable case has. been made out that a wireless set has been used without a licence. Our officers do not, as the honorable member has stated, go about prosecuting everybody. Were they to do so Ave should probably lose more cases than we win. We only take to the courts the cases in which we have absolute proof. The following figures will show clearly what has followed the institution of prosecutions. In New South Wales at one period the number of applications weekly for licences was 2,329 ; but it fell to 523. A warning was then broadcast that persons found to be using sets without a licence to do so would be prosecuted. The number of weekly applications immediately rose to 1,006. A few prosecutions occurred subsequently, and the number of applications then increased to 2,654 weekly. A little later the figure fell to 169 per week. It was then resolved to institute further prosecutions in. cases in which we had absolute proof to submit to the court. Following those actions the number of applications increased to 1,091 per week. This, surely shows the necessity for policing the whole work of broadcasting. If we did not do so, practically no licences would be applied for. The work of policing broadcasting falls upon my department. The number of prosecutions that occurred in 1926 was 427 in New South Wales, and 210 in Victoria. The fines inflicted varied from 10s. to £1 in each case. 

##### Mr Fenton:

-- What about the other States 1 

##### Mr GIBSON:

-- Prosecutions in them were not in the same proportion. Compared with Great Britain we have been lenient, for 579 prosecutions were conducted there last year, and the fine in some cases was £10: It is true, as the honorable member for Werriwa  **(Mr. Lazzarini)**  stated, that  **Mr. Matthews**  only installed his set on the 1st December, and my officers visited his home on the 6th December and 7th December. 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

-- The set was not installed on the 1st December. 

##### Mr GIBSON:

-- It was brought from Sydney and installed on the 1st . December. 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

-- It was only partly installed on that date; the installation was not completed until the 5th December. 

##### Mr GIBSON:

-- The set was installed completely on the 1st December except for the batteries. I did not receive the letter that the honorable member wrote to me in regard to the case until the 17 th December. In reply I told him that I would examine the file 'to ascertain the position. The file came to Melbourne on the 22nd December, Christmas and New Year intervened, and on the 4th January I had it minuted to the effect that the case should be withdrawn. Unfortunately, the letter did not  get away on either that day or the next, and although posted on the Monday, did not reach Sydney in time for the prosecution to he withdrawn. However, Matthews had the opportunity of which I suppose he availed himself, of appearing in court and stating his case. The magistrate saw fit to impose a fine of £1. If Matthews was not satisfied with that decision he could have appealed to a higher court. I am prepared to admit that in a case in which a man had his set for only a week it was something like harsh treatment to proceed against him, for he may have been merely trying it out. But I do not think it would be wise on my part to remit the fine, as there is no doubt that a breach of the regulations, did occur. 

##### Mr Makin:

--  But the Minister evidently recognizes the fairness of the claim for its remission. 

##### Mr GIBSON:

-- I have communicated with the inspectors who are travelling in the district mentioned by the honorable member for Werriwa, and I have ascertained that only one summons has been withdrawn in it. Prosecutions have occurred in every other case in which they were recommended. I do not know why the one case was withdrawn. It is absolutely essential that the department should police broadcasting to ensure that licences are obtained by those who listen in, otherwise the revenue would suffer so badly that the broadcasting companies, especially in the States in which not many licences have been issued, would not have sufficient money to arrange reasonably good programmes. 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Yarra</small>

.- It was not the desire of the honorable member for Werriwa  **(Mr. Lazzarini)**  that there should be a long debate on this matter, and I certainly had no intention to participate in the discussion until certain remarks were made by the PostmasterGeneral  **(Mr. Gibson).**
