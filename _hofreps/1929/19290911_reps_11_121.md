--  *(By leave.)*  -Last night, subsequent to, and in consequence of, thevote that was taken in committee on the Maritime Industries Bill, I stated that theGovernment desired time to consider its position, and moved the adjournment of the House. 

The Government, having considered its position, I, this morning, had an interview with His Excellency the GovernorGeneral, at which I tendered to him certain advice. His Excellency is now considering that advice; consequently, there is no further statement which I can make at the. moment. I, therefore, move - 

  >That the House do now adjourn. 
  >
  >House adjourned  at  3.2 p.m.
