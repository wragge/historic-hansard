#### DISSOLUTION

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs &middot; Flinders &middot; NAT</small>

-- (By  *leave)*  - As a result of the vote in committee on the Maritime Industries Bill, I saw His Excellency the GovernorGeneral, and tendered to him certain advice which, with the consent of His Excellency, I shall read to the House. It was as follows  11th September, 1929. 


 **Sir -** 


I beg to inform you that the second reading of a measure constituting an important part of the policy of the Government, the Maritime Industries Bill, was carried on Saturday last in the House of Representatives by a majority of four votes. Yesterday the bill, on my motion,was declared an urgent measure, also by a majority of four votes. 

In committee an amendment was carried by a majority of one vote declaring that the bill should not be brought into operation until it had been submitted to the people at a referendum or at a general election. 

The Constitution makes no provision for a referendum of this description, and the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to pass effective legislation for the. holding of such a referendum. 

The Government is, however, prepared to accept the other alternative - namely, a general election. 

I, therefore, formally advise Your Excellency . to grant a dissolution of the House ofRepresentatives, and I now inform you that propose to ask Parliament for the necessary financial provision to carry on the public services until after the election has been held. 

Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) S. M.  Bruce, 

Prime Minister. 

His Excellency the Governor-General. 

To-day I received from His Excellency the following reply: -  12th September, 1929. 


 **Sir-** 


I am in receipt of your letterof yesterday, and have carefully considered the question which it raises. 

I note that you propose to ask Parliament for supply to carry on the public services of the Commonwealth until after a general election has been held, and, in view of this assurance, I accept the advice tendered by you. 

Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) Stonehaven, 

Governor-General. 

The Right Honorable S. M. Bruce,C.H., M.C., M.P., Prime Minister. 

The Government proposes to ask the House to grant supply to provide for the public services ofthe Commonwealth during the period that will be necessary for the holding of a general election. In order to protect the revenue, Parliament must also pass a bill validating the customs schedules which were placed before the House during the present session. There must be made, too, a further appropriation to meet our obligations in regard to old-age, invalid, and soldiers' pensions. The only other business which the Government will submit to the House will be a motion for the erection of certain buildings in accordance with the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, so that the work may be proceeded with im- 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Yarra</small>

.- (By  *leave)*  - The Prime Minister has made a very important announcement. This Parliament is but 10 months old. The right honorable gentleman has accepted a grave responsibility in advising the Governor-General to dissolve it, andHis  Excellency  a grave responsibility in accepting that advice. I do not criticize the action of  His Excellency,  nor am I perturbed by the acceptance of the advice tendered to him, but through this House I tell the country that the responsibility for the cost and turmoil of a general election will rest entirely upon the Government. It could have obeyed the mandate it received from the people ten months ago to proceed with the fed- eral arbitration system and make it effective. Had that pledge to the electors not been broken, Parliament would not have insisted upon the Government going again before its masters. Parliament has vindicated itself as the guardian of the people's rights. It has told the Government that, notwithstanding its majority, it cannot flout the will of the people, and that irrespective of -the consequences to any party it must go back to. the electors and get a new mandate, or abandon the measure which was introduced in defiance of the will of the people. The grave responsibility of precipitating a general election so soon after the last one rests entirely upon the advisers ofthe GovernorGeneral, and that will be made clear to the people. The Government disobeyed its mandate.  This  House, in definite terms, has told it to halt, and proceed no further without consulting the electors. I make no complaint for having to face a general election. The Labour party is prepared to meet the Government forces at the polls, and to abide by  the  judgment of the people.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-1-0}
#### DATE OF ELECTION

##### Mr MANN:<br><small class="text-muted">PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Will the Prime Minister  state on what date the election will be held? 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- I am not in a position to state the exact date, but as the Government proposes to ask Parliament for supply for only three months, obviously an early election will be necessary.

#### FLAX INDUSTRY

##### Mr JACKSON:<br><small class="text-muted">BASS, TASMANIA</small>

-- For a considerable time the Tariff Board has been preparing a report on the flax industry. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs state when that report will be available? 

##### Mr GULLETT:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; HENTY, VICTORIA &middot; NAT</small>

-- This report, like a number of others, has recently been receiving the very close consideration of the Government.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-3-0}
#### CONSTITUTION COMMISSION

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">SWAN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I understand that the report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution has been received by the Government. I ask the Prime Minister whether it will be laid on the table before the House is dissolved, or made public through the press at an early date? 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">NAT</small>

-- The Government has not yet received the report, but as soon as it is received consideration will be given to its early publication. 

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">MARIBYRNONG, VICTORIA</small>

-- Seeing that we are approaching a general election, and that during the campaign the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Constitution are likely to be widely discussed, I ask the Prime Minister for a definite assurance that the report will be made available prior to the dissolution, so that the issues which it raises may be discussed more intelligently  than will be possible if it is not made available. The newspapers seem to have obtained certain hints of the contents of the report, and there seems to be little doubt that it is in print. 

##### Mr BRUCE:

-- It is the intention of the Government to give publicity to the report and to make it available for distribution as soon as it is received. The Government has not yet received it. I under stand that it is being printed, but there has been some delay at the Government Printing Office owing to the rush of Parliamentary work. So far as I know, the statements which have appeared in the press respecting the contents of the report have notbeen authorized by theRoyal Commission.

asked the Minister for 

Home Affairs,  *upon notice -* 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. Is it a fact that in houses of high rental in Canberra, laundry coppers have not been bricked in, and that, as a result, many people have been seriously burnt? 
1. If so, when is it expected to satisfactorily complete this work, which has boon left unfinished, in some cases, for over two years? 

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister of Home Affairs &middot; GWYDIR, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; CP</small>

-- The replies to the honorable member's questions are as follow :  - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. So far as Commission houses are concerned, all laundry coppers of a type intended to be bricked in have been bricked in during the construction of the house, irrespective of the rental of the residence concerned. The Commission has no knowledge of the fact that people have been seriously burnt.

asked the Minister for Home Affairs,  *upon notice -* 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. Does the Government intend to follow up the discovery of oil and gas in three bore-holes at Lakes Entrance, Gippsland, Victoria? 
1. In view of the statements made that natural gas has thrown up thousands of tons of mud, creating an island in Lake Victoria, will the Government consider instructing the Broughton Edge Geophysical Survey Group to make a survey on Sperm Whale Head, Lake Victoria? 

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

-- The replies to the honorable member's questions are as follow :  - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. This area is under the jurisdiction of the Victorian Government, but the Commonwealth Geological Adviser and the Commonwealth Palaentologist are co-operating with the Victorian Geological Survey in regard to the examination of the district. 

It is presumed that the island referred to by the honorable member is that known as Mud Island. The Commonwealth Geological Adviser has reported that Mud Island is not a vent through which quantities of mud have been ejected into the air, but that, on the contrary, it is held to be a purely superficial phenomenon, not of the nature of a " mud volcano " and in no way connected with oilfield phenomena.

3. As Port Augusta is essentially a Commonwealth railway town, in which the Commonwealth owns wharfs and sea front, with other activities and interests, will he consider the requests that have been made to co-operate with the State Government concerning this matter ? 
4. Has he considered the requests previously made, and, if so, what is his decision? 

##### Mr PATERSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Markets and Transport &middot; GIPPSLAND, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

{: type="1" start="1"}

1. Yes. The position of overseas settlers in Victoria, including Imperial ex-service men, under the Migration Agreement, is at present the subject of consideration between the Development and Migration Commission and the Victorian authorities.

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- Does the Prime Minister intend to allow a discussion upon Order of the Day No. 3, "Federal Capital Territory  - Future form of Government - Ministerial statement - Printing of Paper." I cannot allow his eulogium of  **Sir John**  Butters to pass unchallenged. 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs &middot; Flinders &middot; NAT</small>

.- Such a discussion would not be in order. In view of the impending dissolution, the only business with which the Government can proceed is the provision of the necessary supply to carry on the services of Government until after the election, the provision of moneys to meet commitments in respect of old-age and war pensions, and the passing of the measures necessary for the protection of the revenue. The Government is not in a position, nor is it entitled, to proceed with other business.

### SUPPLY BILL (NO. 2) 1929-30

Message recommending appropriation reported and ordered to be taken into consideration forthwith. 


 *In Committee of Supply:* 


Motion (by  **Dr. Earle**  Page) agreed to - 

  >That there bc granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services of the year 1929-1930 a sum not exceeding £6,578,090. 

Resolution reported. 

Standing Orders suspended and resolution adopted. 

Resolution of Ways and Means founded on resolution of Supply reported and adopted. 


 *Ordered -* 


  >That  **Dr. Earle**  Page and  **Mr. Bruce**  do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. 

Bill presented by  **Dr. Earle**  Page and read a first time. 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; Cowper &middot; CP</small>

-- I move - 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

The available appropriation under Supply Bill No. 1 of 1929-30 is almost exhausted and it is necessary to make a further appropriation of revenue to carry on the services of the Commonwealth pending the passing of the Estimates. The committee is now asked to appropriate £6,578,090, which will meet requirements for the months of September, October and 

November. This sum includes the following services : - 


<graphic href="121331192909124_4_0.jpg"></graphic>


The items which make up these sums are based approximately on either last year's appropriation or the current year's estimates, whichever is the lower. Provision has also been made for the pay day which falls on the 13th December next. No new proposal has been included. 

##### Mr Theodore:

--  Not even new proposals in the Estimates? 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:

-- No new proposal in the Estimates is included in the bill. In addition, provision has been made for "Refunds of Revenue", £100,000, and "Advance to the Treasurer", £1,500,000. The latter sura is required mainly to enable loan works and services in progress to be continued until the Loan Bill has been approved by Parliament. The average monthly expenditure on those services is about £450,000. It has also been necessary to make provision out of Treasurer's advance to carry on works and services in respect of "Additions, New Works and Buildings - Payable from Revenue " until parliamentary appropriation is available, and to meet miscellaneous and unforseen contingencies incidental to the services of the Commonwealth. 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Yarra</small>

.- Although the Treasurer has stated that no new items have been included, there are certain items to which I should take exception if we were discussing the Estimates. Notwithstanding that, however, we are agreeable to this supply being granted so that the Government may be enabled to go to the country. After the elections have been held it is probable that another government will be in power; and should this party be returned it will make radical alterations in respect to the remainder of the financial year. 

##### Mr COLEMAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

.- I have received from the Postal Workers Union in Sydney an urgent telegram in the following terms: - 

  >Approximately 12 line branch employees discharged to-day, addition about 90 past fortnight, further 300 that were to go next two months. Dismissals apply metropolitan area. Cannot those dismissed be re-employed as all were engaged profitable employment? Have also wired Bruce and Gibson. 

Is the Postmaster General  **(Mr. Gibson)**  in a position to state whether .the men who have been dismissed can be reemployed? Rumour has it that the Government is willing to keep in employment the 300 men whom it was proposed to put off, but that the 100 men who have already been dismissed cannot be reemployed. 

##### Mr GIBSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Postmaster General &middot; Corangamite &middot; CP</small>

-- -I have received a telegram similar to that which the honorable member has read, and am having investigations made into the matter. Quite a number of men are having their services dispensed with in New South Wales, because the amount of money appropriated is not .sufficient to employ the staff we have had in the past and the amount of work undertaken this year will not be so great as it was last year. At the moment I cannot say what number will be put out of employment on that account; but honorable members can rest assured that whatever number the appropriation allows will be kept in employment. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.

 *In committee* (Consideration of GovernorGeneral's message) - 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; Cowper &middot; CP</small>

-- I move - 

  >That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum for invalid and old-age pensions. 

The purpose of this measure is to provide from the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of £10,000,000 for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. From time to time Parliament has made appropriations of a similar amount, and transfers have been made under the authority of the relative Appropriation Acts to the trust account from which payments are made to pensioners. The total amount previously appropriated for this purpose is £101,250,000, of which £98,296,126 had been expended up to the 30th June last, leaving a balance on that date of £2,953,874. This balance is sufficient to meet payments up to the last pay day in September, and a further appropriation is now required to provide for payments from October onwards. The sum which the committee is now asked to appropriate will meet requirements for approximately twelve months. The measure has no relation to the rate of pensions or the conditions under which they are payable. 

##### Mr WATKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">Newcastle</small>

.- In common with other honorable members, I consider it is high time that inquiry was made into the administration of this legislation, particularly as it affects invalids. I have had brought under my notice numerous cases of persons who are unable to do any work; yet they are told by those whose duty it is to authorize pensions that they are capable of doing some work. Presumably, that decision is come to in the light of the medical reports. They may he able only to wash a. cup, or perform some slight service of that nature. The administration is too rigid. I know of a boy who is practically paralysed down one side.  His  chest has wasted away. He has almost to drag himself along the floor, and he has been told by the administration that he can do some light employment. That is one of the serious anomalies that should be rectified. Irrespective of the trend of politics at the present time, let me say that it is high time that the Minister took steps to compel those who administer the law in respect of old-age and invalid pensions, to carry out their duties properly. 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; Cowper &middot; CP</small>

-- The question of medical reports has been engaging the attention of the Government, and careful consideration is being given to the position. 

Question resolved in the affirmative.

### WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION BILL

Message recommending appropriation reported, and ordered to be taken into consideration in committee forthwith. 


 *In committee:* (Consideration of Governor-General's message) - 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; Cowper &middot; CP</small>

-- I move - 

  >That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum for war pensions. 

The purpose of the bill is to provide the sum of £10,000,000 from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the payment of war pensions. Parliament has, from time to time, made appropriations of a similar amount, and transfers have been made under the authority of the relative appropriation acts to the trust account from which payments are made to pensioners. The total amount previously appropriated for this purpose was £75,622,632, of which £72,116,683 had been expended, up to the 30th June last, the balance on that date being £3,505,949. This balance is sufficient to meet war-pension payments up to the middle of November next. -A further appropriation is required -to provide for payments from November onwards. The appropriation which the committee is now asked to make will meet requirements until approximately December, 1930. I would add that this measure has nothing whatever to do with the rate of pensions or the conditions under which they are payable. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Resolution reported. 

Standing Orders suspended  and resolution adopted.

### CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL

Motion (by  **Mr. Gullett)**  -  *by leave -*  agreed to - 

  >That he have leave to bring in a bill for an Act to provide for the validation of collections of duties of customs under tariff proposals. 

Bill presented- by  **Mr. Gullett,**  and read a first time. 

{:#subdebate-17-0}
#### Second Reading

##### Mr GULLETT:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; Henty &middot; NAT</small>

--  *(By leave)*  - I move - 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

This measure is necessary for the validation of the collection of duties under the revenue tariff proposals contained in the motion submitted to the House on the 22nd August last. As the House is aware, those duties became operative when tabled, but it is necessary that they should be validated during the life of the Parliament in which they were introduced! In the event of a dissolution prior to validation, they would lapse, and the extra duties collected under them would have to be refunded. Therefore, honorable members will recognize the necessity for this measure. It is not intended in any sense to be the last word upon this schedule. The validation is only for the brief period ending the 20th December next? 

##### Mr Hughes:

--  Is that stated in the bill? 

##### Mr GULLETT:

-- Yes. Honorable members will have the fullest opportunity to discuss the duties within the next three months. 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Yarra</small>

.- As the Minister has said, this bill validates the schedule that has been tabled. The schedule contains some items with which I thoroughly agree, as, for example, the protective duty that has been levied on imported tobacco to encourage the tobacco industry in Australia. That duty would be supported, I believe, by most honorable  members, and it would be a pity to jeopardize the protection of the industry by failure to validate the schedule that has been tabled. The schedule contains, too, some items which I oppose just as strongly as I support others, and, were it not for the fact that the Government has agreed to limit the operation of the measure to a period of three months, honorable members on this side of the House would oppose it. In view of that limitation of time, the Opposition is not prepared to vote against the bill, although it includes some items with which we disagree, and others with which we agree. The effect of the bill will really be" the same as if the schedule were allowed to remain on the table for another three months. It is now clear that, unless this Parliament determines otherwise, this schedule will cease to have effect at the end of three months, and another Parliament will be asked to consider a new schedule, which I hope will contain the good features of the present schedule, but not the bad ones. 

##### Mr Hughes:

-- Is that quite clear? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:

-- That is the position. The bill can operate only until the 20th December. 

##### Mr Marks:

-- The increased duties will be collected until that date. 

##### Mr SCULLIN:

-- Yes. The measure also validates the collection of duties under the schedule since August last. 

##### Mr Stewart:

-- But it does not commit those honorable members who disapprove of it. 

##### Mr SCULLIN:

-- It commits us to nothing; it merely enables the Government legally to collect the new duties until 'the date mentioned, and, when that time arrives, Parliament will have control of the situation. If a new schedule embodying these duties were placed on the table, Parliament could immediately object to any of them. The present duties are not validated beyond the date fixed in the hill. 

##### Mr Hughes:

-- If a new schedule is not tabled after the election, the whole of these duties lapse. 

##### Mr SCULLIN:

-- Yes. We have to. accept the bad with the good; but their operation is limited to the period of three months. I understood that the intention of the Government was to make the period four months; but I made m_v opinion known, and the Government met the Opposition by limiting the operation of the duties to three months. Supply has been granted for three months, and that, too, includes provision for expenditure with which the Opposition does not agree, and which this Parliament would be entitled to criticize if it had the Estimates before it. We have agreed to the operation of the schedule for the limited period of three months to enable the election to be held and a newly-constituted House to assemble here. So the reason for the granting of three months' supply is the same as that for the validation of the collection of these duties for three months. Therefore, I do not propose to vote against the bill, although it contains features with which the Opposition disagrees and against which it will certainly fight during the coming election. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

-- I would have preferred the Government to bring in a bill to validate the  collection of these duties to the present time, and give the House a proper opportunity to discuss the matter, because, when taxation is to be imposed on the people, their representatives in Parliament should at least be permitted to voice their opinion as to the fairness or necessity for those taxes. I do not think that it is essential that there should be increased taxation. Had due economy been exercised, these increased duties would not have been  ncessary.  When it is found imperative to impose increased taxes they should be placed on what may be termed luxuries. Unfortunately, the cost of living is increasing year by year. Nearly every other country has made a big effort to bring about a return to normal conditions. I hope that after the election the object of the Government - the present Government, I trust - will be to reduce the cost of living. That means that the cost of production must come down. It is no use living in a fool's paradise. Under the present conditions we are on shifting sands. We are dependent to too great a'n extent upon borrowed money. We are taking huge sums from the people which should be used for development in order to provide  employment.  I have already asked the Minister by way of questions in  the House, and I now ask the Government, to consider the remission of the duty on motor truck chassis which are being largely used in the development of rural areas. I hope that, until the matter can be fully investigated, the Government will approve of a small amendment that will enable these chassis to be admitted duty free. I do not wish to obstruct the passage of the bill ; but I ask the Government to realize that motor trucks are extensively employed in developmental work. Until we are satisfied that we can get these trucks on the free list from Great Britain equal to those from the United States, we should not further burden the country. 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs &middot; Flinders &middot; NAT</small>

--  Many members on both sides would doubtless desire to take exception to particular items in the schedules that have been laid on the table. 

##### Mr Gregory:

--  A motor chassis cannot be regarded as a luxury. 

##### Mr BRUCE:

-- I am not discussing the merits of these duties imposed; I am merely reminding the House that, the schedule contains many items to which exception might be taken from one side or the other. But, as I intimated to the House earlier in the afternoon, I have tendered certain advice to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, who has agreed to a dissolution subject to the granting of supply and the necessary protection of the revenue. Once a dissolution has been granted, it is not permissible for the Parliament to pass additional legislation or alter any existing legislation. It can take steps to provide the necessary moneys to carry on the services of government until after the election, and to safeguard the revenue; but it may not introduce new duties or vary duties that are already operative. Whatever views honorable members may hold regarding the duties under consideration, it is now too late to deal further with them. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that he disagrees with a number of the items in the schedule, but these duties are actually operative. 

Question- resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time. 


 *In committee:* 


The bill. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

--  I do not care what any one says to the contrary, I maintain that the responsibility of imposing taxation on the people rests with this chamber, and with this chamber alone. I do not care what the situation in Parliament may be, the duty is ours, before we allow taxation to be imposed, either to approve or disapprove. 

Bill agreed to and reported without amendment; report adopted.

### BOTANICAL LABORATORIES, CANBERRA

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Home Affairs &middot; Gwydir &middot; CP</small>


 *.- (By leave)- I* move - 

  >That iii accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee * Act 1913-1921, the following proposed work, which was referred to and reported upon by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, be proceeded with, viz., Erection of Botanical Laboratories at Canberra. 

At these laboratories investigation will be conducted into matters relating to animal nutrition, economic entomology, economic botany and animal health. This work is at present being carried out in temporary premises and in the laboratories of the universities and State government departments. A great deal of inconvenience has been caused by this, and the work cannot be done so efficiently as if the whole staff was housed under one roof. If the House agrees to this proposal the construction of the necessary building can be undertaken at an early date. The cost will be £52,000. 

##### Mr MANN:<br><small class="text-muted">Perth</small>

--  I cannot allow this motion to go through without voicing a protest. We are now on the eve of a dissolution of Parliament. The Government has brought down proposals for a very heavy increase in taxation, while, at the same time, it proposes to proceed with what the public of Australia regards as grossly extravagant expenditure on the Federal Capital. It has been stated that £700,000 is to be spent on Canberra this year. The governments of to-day are concerned chieflywith finance, and the concern of the public is whether or not a government is economically spending the public revenues and whether the heavy taxation imposed is justified. An important step of this kind should not be decided before the election. If this motion is passed the country will be committed to an expenditure of £52,000. Before the work is completed I believe it will cost £70,000 at least. 

##### Mr J FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">MORETON, QUEENSLAND &middot; NAT; UAP from 1931; LP from 1944</small>

--  No, it will not 

##### Mr MANN:

-- I am going on the meagre information available. 

##### Mr J FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">MORETON, QUEENSLAND &middot; NAT; UAP from 1931; LP from 1944</small>

--  The report has been before the House a long time. 

##### Mr MANN:

-- It has not ; it was tabled only yesterday or the day before. The time has arrived when a halt must be called to expenditure. The public is crying out about the wasteful extravagance at Canberra. There is no real need for this work, and in any case Parliament should not be asked to agree to the expenditure of this sum when the whole policy of the Government is to be placed before the people. The Government's proposal represents a breach of the trust which the people repose in Parliament, and I shall vote against it. 

##### Mr WEST:<br><small class="text-muted">East Sydney</small>

.- No other undertaking authorized by Parliament during the last ten years has had more to justify it than this has. This is a proposal for carrying out an important work to which we are pledged. In many ways we are still suffering from the folly of past mal-administration, and the present proposal of the Government represents a step towards recovering some of the lost ground. I heartily support this proposal, and if the cost were to be twice as much I would still support it. In the laboratories which are to be built, experts will investigate such matters as soil improvement, and the evolution of improved grasses and plants. It will be a work of great national importance, one which will help 

Australia to meet and overcome economic competition from other countries. Primary production will be stimulated and increased. The honorable member for Perth  **(Mr. Mann)**  would not oppose the motion if he understood the subject. I sympathize with him because his environment has prevented him from becoming acquainted with some of the problems concerning which I have endeavoured to educate the House. During the last Parliament I moved that the Government should set aside an area of 20 square miles in the Federal Capital Territory for the purposes of a research institute, station, and farm, and I suggested a means whereby the necessary money might be raised. The same motion appears on the Notice-paper for this session. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member will not be in order in anticipating the debate on that motion. 

##### Mr WEST:

-- I am merely pointing out that the proposal submitted by the Minister is in consonance with the larger one to which I wish to get the assent of this House. This morning I received from  **Sir George**  Julius,  Chairman  of the Bureau of Science and Industry, three pages of foolscap in which he highly commended my proposal, and pointed out how essential it is that such an institute should be established as soon as possible. In Great Britain similar institutes have been in operation since 1843 and have aided to a marked degree the progress of primary production in the Old Country. In the United States of America research work is regarded as fundamental to progress. To every professional man in the Commonwealth, the leading professors at the universities, and 770 newspapers, I have distributed copies of a pamphlet setting out the details of my scheme, and by not one has it been adversely criticized. A few weeks ago  **Mr. McMasters,**  a prominent pastoralist, and successful experimenter in the improvement of our flocks, offered £20,000 towards a fund to promote research in the pastoral industry. The Graziers Association has proposed that a fund of £200,000 should be established, and if the Government supports the proposal on national grounds, I am sure the money will be raised. An institute such as is proposed will be the envy of the world. In seeking to lower the cost of production we should not interfere with wages until we can assure to the people cheaper food. No proposal ever submitted to the House was more justified than is the motion now before us. It is recommended by the Works Committee, which has shown a breadth of vision for which it cannot be too highly commended. 

##### Mr McWILLIAMS:<br><small class="text-muted">FRANKLIN, TASMANIA &middot; REV TAR; ANTI-SOC from 1906; LP from 1910; NAT from 1917; CP from 1920; IND from 1928</small>

-- I do not propose to discuss the merits of the proposal mentioned in the motion, but it is almost unprecedented for a Government, after a dissolution has been granted, to ask the expiring Parliament to agree to a vote that will commit the new Parliament. 

##### Mr Theodore:

--  It does not commit the new Parliament. 

##### Mr McWILLIAMS:<br><small class="text-muted">FRANKLIN, TASMANIA</small>

-- My view is that this motion will do so ; therefore, I oppose it. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

.- The protest made by the honorable member for Perth  **(Mr. Mann)**  is in accordance with the views of the majority of people. The economic position of Canberra is a horror. What can be shown for the £12,000,000 that has been expended in the creation of this city? If the proposed expenditure of £52,000 would do anything towards insuring proper food for human beings and teach them how to avoid disease, I would support it. At the same time, I recognize that diseases of stock should be thoroughly studied so that the meat we eat may be wholesome and that which we export to Europe may be able to compete on favorable terms with that of the Argentine. The War Office has given to the Argentine, in preference to Australia, contracts for the supply of meat to the Army and Navy. Even the deadly poison formalin was used to preserve meat for export to the Homeland, and God alone knows how many men, women, and children have paid with their lives for that infamy. At the recent medical congress in Sydney, testimony was given that the dreadful disease, cancer, which menaces every old man, may be caused in time by the irritation of the intestines, due to certain substances. Amongst the contributors to such irritationare the preservatives and other impurities in foods. The finest white flour is now recognized to be almost deadly; it has little or no food value, because the best parts of the grain have been extracted during the gristing process and used as offal. Sugar, rice, and other foods also lose value through over-refinement. In connexion with the estimate of £52,000 for the proposed institute, I hope that we shall not have a repetition of previous occurrences under the administration of  **Sir John**  Butters. 

##### Mr Fenton:

--  He is retiring. Leave him alone. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- Thank God he is retiring. I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs  **(Mr. Abbott),**  if he is returned to office - if not, his successor - will see that the estimates given to Parliament are adhered to, and that if the estimate for this proposed work is exceeded, the officer responsible will be punished. This Parliament House, which was originally estimated to cost. £230,000, has absorbed nearly £700,000 of the taxpayers money. I hope we shall not be told later that an institute estimated to cost £52,000 has actually cost £150,000. I make this protest as a reminder to whomever the officer concerned may be, that works must be completed within the estimated amounts, particularly in this time of economic stress, when the people are staggering under a load of debt, much of which has been unjustly placed on their shoulders. 

Question resolved in the affirmative.

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs &middot; Flinders &middot; NAT</small>

.  - I move- 

  >That the House do now adjourn. 

I desire to express to you,Mr.  Speaker,  our appreciation of the manner in which you have conducted the business of the House. We are also grateful to the  Chairman  of Committees for his services. Every honorable member of the House would also desire me to thank the Clerks at the table, who, as in the past, have during this Parliament rendered all possible assistance to honorable members in the performance of their duties. We thank, too, the members of the  *Hansard*  staff for the manner in which they have performed their laborious and difficult work, which is sometimes rendered more difficult than it need be by honorable members themselves. They render great service to honorable members, and one sincerely trusts - although some of us may have grave doubts about the matter - to posterity also. We are grateful, also, to the attendants of the House for their unwearying courtesy and attention to our  needs. 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Yarra</small>

.- I heartily endorse the remarks of the Prime Minister regarding yourself,  **Mr. Speaker,**  the  Chairman  of Committees, the officers at the table, the  *Hansard*  staff, and the attendants of the House. You, sir, have always been fair and impartial in the chair, and in all respects have upheld the highest traditions of your office. The Prime Minister said that some honorable members had made the task of the  *Hansard*  staff more difficult than it need have been. That may be true, yet no one has made it more difficult than the Government has done; because, whatever the disabilities of honorable members during a 46-hours sitting, those of the Clerks at the table, the  *Hansard*  staff, and the chamber attendants must be very much greater. We sympathize with them in what they have thus suffered. Unlike honorable members, they cannot curl themselves up in a quiet place in a blanket, and sleep while others talk. I am sure that we all appreciate the courtesy and capable assistance of all the officials of Parliament. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Batman</small>

-- I do not desire to strike a discordant note upon this happy occasion, when we are on the eve of our return to our homes. I cordially support the remarks made by the Prime Minister, and endorsed by the Leader of the Labour party. While regretting that the exigencies of political life forbid me to express the hope that we shall all meet again in the next Parliament, I may be permitted to say that I trust that we shall, at least, have the privilege of meeting all of our friends now and again in the lobbies. I understand that one honorable member opposite has linked up with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and proposes to make extensive and exhaustive research in the swamps of the middle-west of New South Wales into the origin and genesis of fangless snakes. In these circumstances, we could not think of breaking in upon his inquiries with the more active work of a member of Parliament. I understand that another honorable member opposite is already engaged in the manufacture for himself of a crown of martyrdom, which is to be hung in some convenient place in the electorate of Wakefield. None can tell what fortune may hold in store for him. We can only wait and pray - pray rather than wait - because there is ah active time ahead of us. Many of us have condemned Canberra in round terms, but most of us long to return to it. With all its faults, we love it still. I like change, and in the next Parliament I shall be quite content if we who sit on your left, sir, enjoy the changed view that is to be had from your right. Such a change will be eminently satisfactory. I wish no person any harm. The worst that can happen to any of us is to be given temporary rest, which surely all of us have earned and deserve. It is my  cordial wish that that may be given to some honorable gentlemen who now sit on your right. I believe it will be given to them in rich measure - not, perhaps, the rest which comes from the consciousness of having done right and served one's country disinterestedly; but rest of another kind, which is better than none at all. I am grateful to you, sir, for having presided so impartially and ably over this chamber. It is not for me to express the hope that you may occupy your present position when the new Parliament meets. That Parliament will be the master of its own destiny, and who can tell who will then occupy the position that you now fill? Who can tell, also, who will be  Chairman  of Committees; and whether he will sit out the whole of the gloomy period allotted for debate, or be tempted by parliamentary circumstances to leave the chair ten minutes earlier than the fixed time? Political work is very exacting, and although we always hope to stay the distance we sometimes fail when we have almost reached the goal. Maybe that will be the fate of the  Chairman  of Committees; I cannot say. The answers to all these questions are wrapped in the mists of the future. 

I most cordially thank you, sir, and the officers of this House. I sincerely hope it may be the dispensation of the wise Providence that guards the interests of this country that we who now sit on this side shall return in sufficient numbers to justify our taking our places on the other side. We certainly deserve to do so; and in such an event we shall do justice to our country. 

##### Mr STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">Wimmera</small>

.- During the last election campaign, I understand, wireless broadcasting facilities were made available to the leaders of the respective parties, once in each State. Wireless has expanded, so enormously that it has become a most effective means of reaching the people, particularly in remote centres. I ask the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Bruce)**  and the Postmaster-General  **(Mr. Gibson),**  if possible to extend the facilities to include not only the leaders of parties but also - to a limited extent, at any rate - all other candidates. If that is not possible I ask that the privilege may be accorded to at least the right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes)**  because of the fact that the election is considered necessary in consequence of the vote that was taken on the amendment which he moved to the Maritime Industries Bill, and that that will be the principal issue in the campaign. I may mention that I have not discussed this matter with the right honorable gentleman, and that I make the request without his knowledge. The issues should be put to the people as clearly and effectively as possible. 

I understand that in the party room this morning the Prime Minister made a definite statement regarding the date of the election. If that is so, it is due to honorable members who sit on this side that a similar statement be made here. The right honorable gentleman can, at least, be more definite than he was earlier in the day. 

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Maribyrnong</small>

-- I do not know whether it is for the Government to say whose speeches shall be broadcasted, or whether that decision lies with other persons. I question whether, in all. fairness, it should be the prerogative of any ministry. The fair way would be to allow the matter to be decided by a committee quite independent of party politics. 

##### Mr Atkinson:

--  The programmes are bad enough now. 

##### Mr FENTON:

-- I suggest that the honorable member speak for himself. I trust that even-handed justice will be meted out. I am not looking for any such privilege, because I can do very well .without it. 

There is another matter which transcends in importance that of the broadcasting of election speeches. If we are spared by a kindly Providence to take part in the deliberations of the next Parliament, we should set our faces sternly against all-night sittings, which are. iniquitous. They are hard enough for members of Parliament to endure, but it is cruel in the extreme to impose such a hardship upon members of the  *Hansard*  staff and other officers of Parliament. I trust that those of us who are returned by the electors will make up their minds to see that the business is so conducted that the best results will be achieved for those who send us here. It is absolutely' impossible to do the work of this country as it should be done if we are obliged  to remain here when, we should be reposing in our  beds.  I heartily endorse the remarks of my leader  **(Mr. Scullin)**  and the honorable member for Batman  **(Mr. Brennan).** 

I know .that, at times, I am a nuisance to the Chair, but when I first entered this Parliament, over twenty years ago, I said that, as it was quite likely I would say or do things not strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders, I hoped that I should always" be manly enough to admit being in the wrong, and to make due redress. I leave my record to speak for itself, and I join with others in expressing heartfelt thanks to you,  **Mr. Speaker,**  and to the clerks and to the  *Hansard*  reporters for the splendid services they have rendered, not only to individual members, but also to the country at large. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Fremantle</small>

.- As one of the new members of this Parliament, I should like,  **Mr. Speaker,**  to express to you and to the officers generally my appreciation of the great consideration that has been extended to me, and I extend that expression of appreciation to fellow members of my party and to all other .honorable members. 

##### Mr COLEMAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

.- The date of the forthcoming election is unquestionably a matter of great public interest, and should not be kept a close Government secret. There is a large number of candidates available to oppose the Government's policy, and these candidates should certainly be in a position to know when they will be able to take the field. 

##### Mr J FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">MORETON, QUEENSLAND &middot; NAT; UAP from 1931; LP from 1944</small>

-- There will be a large number of candidates in the field to support the Government's policy. 

##### Mr COLEMAN:

-- I venture to say there will be a larger number behind the right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes),**  the honorable member for Fawkner  **(Mr. Maxwell)**  and others opposite who are opposing the Government's policy. I think the Government should indicate immediately the date of the election, because considerable public inconvenience is involved in the withholding of the information. It must be obvious to every one that the date has already been fixed by the Government. 

##### Mr ANSTEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

.- It is apparent from the number of honorable members anxious to catch your eye,  **Mr. Speaker,**  that if I do not say a few valedictory words on this occasion, someone else will do so. To the prayers, anthems, dirges, and thanksgivings we have already heard, I therefore add my chant. 

I want first of all to say to the honorable member for Reid  **(Mr. Coleman)**  that there is no reason why the Government should disclose to him, or to any other honorable  member of the Opposition, the day on which the election is to be held. In any case, why should the honorable member worry? "We all know what the result will be! The honorable member forgets that this is war. The Government is making a surprise attack, and naturally the date on which the attack, or in other words the election, is to take place is something that it will keep up its sleeve. 

Never in my political career have I been more overjoyed than I have been to hear my dear friend, Llew. Atkinson, come to light, as he has done during the last few days. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- An honorable member must not be referred to in that way. He should be addressed by the name of his constituency. 

##### Mr ANSTEY:

-- I apologize. I am speaking of the honorable member for Wilmot  **(Mr. Atkinson).**  Never has he been so bright, so cheery, so witty or so humorous ; never so little sleepy as he has been during the last few days. It is said that misfortune makes us bright and alert. The transformation that has come over the honorable member since he is no longer in the Ministry is wonderful. I congratulate him, and for the benefit of his electors, I hope that he will never again have to bear the worries of ministerial office. 

It is said that all-night sittings are harmful, but,  **Mr. Speaker,**  is it not true that, during these tests of endurance, we are entertained by harmonious notes that are never struck during the ordinary sitting hours? Who can have but pleasant memories of our recent all-night sittings - memories that will last as long as life endures ? You,  **Mr. Speaker,**  must have enjoyed the deep bass of the honorable member for Wannon  **(Mr. Rodgers)**  as he slept ! How deep ! How sonorous ! How like a church organ ! And then, now and again, could be heard the cornet-like notes of the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Archdale Parkhill)**  as he intoned his thanksgivings. Of course, he was not listening to the discussion or hearing arguments which, had he been awake and listening to them, would have converted him and compelled him to vote against the Government. 

If you,  **Mr. Speaker,**  are returned at the forthcoming election, and we are returned to power, I can assure you on behalf of the Labour party that you shall continue to adorn the chair which you have so worthily filled for some time past. At- any rate, sir, you will do so as long as I have any influence in the party. I say this because I take a broad, national view. Do I not remember the consideration you have extended to me time after time when in this chamber I have wandered from the path of political rectitude? I have nothing but feelings of gratitude for a  Speaker  who can be so generous to old sinners like myself, and you shall be  Speaker  for ever if I have power to keep you in the position. 

We are now on the way to the graveside of some members of this House. Let us hope that it will be that of our opponents. We shall bury them with feelings of gratitude, mingled with feelings of sadness. The fortunes of war necessitate that in a political struggle some must die; hut on such an occasion we prefer to bury our political opponents - of course, with every honour, even though we may be put to the expense of floral tributes. In these contests we are apt to make all manner of assertions about each other, but I make a promise to those who support the Government. My general rule of conduct is to observe humility and kindness in dealing with my opponents unless I am assailed, and even then the attack must be warm. It is only now and then that I am aroused. The promise I make is that in this contest on the public platforms of Australia I shall try to uphold that dignity which I always seek to maintain in this chamber. I shall not say one word against my opponents that can be regarded as being other than in good taste or dignified. I may, of course, say, in company with the honorable member for Richmond  **(Mr. R. Green),**  that my opponents are " maggots," or I may paraphrase the words of the honorable member for Gwydir  **(Mr. Abbott),**  and describe them as " snakes whose fangs have been drawn." Or I may use the words of my old friend the Treasurer, and describe them as being " infected with tetanus germs." But I shall not mean what I say. Such language as that will only be for the sake of publicity. With the usual decency that adorns our public life, after assailing each other's private characters on public platforms, we can still have our cups of tea together. We may talk of "running sores," but in the  corridors of this building we can still shake each other's hands. I might go still higher in the matter of culture - I cannot help my superiority, since God has made me superior - and say of some of my opponents what the right honorable the Prime Minister said of  **Mr. Charlton,**  "So ignorant; so degrading to public life"; or as he said of another's speech, "It violates every decency of public life." We shall say all these things, and yet when we come hack again - triumphant on this side, I hope - we shall resume our friendships. Nevertheless, on this occasion I trust that on the public platform and elsewhere we shall observe decency of manners, and decency of address. In this respect our language will not lose by. comparison with that used by honorable members supporting the Government when they speak of us on the public platforms of this country. 


 **Dr.** MALONEY  (Melbourne) ]4.55[.We, like the gladiators of old, salute you,  **Mr. Speaker,**  as men about to die, but although we die as members of this Parliament, we, or at least the majority of us, hope soon to rise again as members of the next. This is my last opportunity to protest in this Parliament against the enormous expenditure on the roof of this building. Some time ago I drew the attention of the Government to the had condition of the roof, and I was told that a certain sum of money had been reserved until the contractors had made the roof  perfect. Parliament went into recess, and before it met again the Commission, put 80 tons of gravel on the roof and repaired it at an expense of £2,500. How much were the contractors made to pay for those repairs? The Commission withheld £877 from them, but it expended £2,500. Did the roof stop leaking.? No, and I understand that it is still leaking. I protest against this waste of money. Why did not the Commission make John Howie and Sons complete their job? Were they not able to construct a roof properly? The Commissioner, who has been eulogized by the Prime Minister, passed the expense on to the country. The cost was £2,500, and only £877 was debited against J. Howie and Sons. Even that firm claims to have been unjustly treated by the Commission. 

Another matter to which I wish to refer is that of the building of the" theatre at Canberra. The unfortunate nian who built it, placed his plans before the commissioners, who passed and endorsed them. The plans provided for a roof which would enable a fireproof curtain to be installed in the theatre, but some one discovered that the roof was out of alignment with that of Parliament House. This unfortunate man was put to an additional expense of £900 without receiving one penny compensation. The present roof does not permit of the provision of a fireproof curtain, therefore a grave injustice has been done, because, without such a curtain, the manager is able to exhibit only moving pictures. He cannot have a theatrical performance without permission. There was no room in the roof to enable a fireproof curtain to bc raised, and the Commission suggested  that a  room 12 feet by 12 feet should be built at the corner of the fl ys. Any one who understands anything about an asbestos curtain knows that such an arrangement would soon destroy it. Later on, that great Shakespearean actor, Allan Wilkie, wished to give a performance in the capital of Australia. The manager of the theatre made application to the Chief Commissioner for permission to use it for that purpose, and the Commissioner  waited  twelve days before answering. Allan Wilkie could not wait, so at that time Canberra lost the opportunity of seeing the great  Shakepearean  actor. Later on, the position was remedied. The Commission unjustly wronged the builder of the theatre by putting him to additional expenditure without one penny compensation. 

I come now to Parliament House, this wonderful structure which was estimated to cost £220,000. Has the person who made that estimate been suspended or dismissed for his fault? The cost of this building, to June, 192S, was £617,516. That is how the people's money is wasted, and I lay the charge of wasteful expenditure at the door of the Commission, principally. The most useful act that the Chief Commissioner does will be to leave Canberra. The words "Thank God!" will then echo in many homes in Canberra, and the people are even now offering prayers of thanksgiving because the dictator's reign has about finished. 

I cannot wish the Government the good fortune to return to office. I candidly admit that I never allow friendship to interfere with politics. In a political fight my opponents are my enemies, and I hope that most honorable members supporting the Government will soon sink into the limbo of political oblivion. Whether this Government is returned, which I doubt, or another government takes its place, does not alter the fact that it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to abolish the present absurd system of estimating the cost of building at Canberra. This building, although of a temporary character, was estimated to cost £220,000, yet its actual cost was over £617,000. Is it any wonder that Canberra has earned the name of being an open malignant ulcer upon the finances of Australia? I am certain that the majority of honorable members in their hearts would like Canberra closed down altogether. Any business firm that had branches in the capital cities would close down any branch that was not paying. The Federal Capital should have been situated at a place like Albury or the North Shore of Sydney. Under act of Parliament we were permitted to take up land at its valuation, and 27 or 28 years ago the value of 100 or 150 acres on the North Shore of Sydney would not have been very considerable. Albury is a wonderful city, situated on the banks of Australia's greatest river. It will shortly have adjacent to it a lake larger than Sydney Harbour. Had Albury been chosen as the Federal Capital City, it would have now had a population of 100,000. Its citizens would have been paying their dues to Australia, and no loss would have been made. What is the present position? We have the abominable system of building from a circumference instead of from a centre. This is the first time in the history of the world that such a system has been introduced. Canberra has a paltry population of 7,000, and yet the city is divided into 22 sections. When one goes out at night, the enormous number of lights reminds one of Sydney or some other large city. I have taken this opportunity of protesting against the action of the Federal Capital Commissioners, and I have no hesitation in saying that when the history of Canberra is written it will clearly show that the tremendous amount of unnecessary expenditure incurred has placed an exceptionally heavy burden upon the finances of the Commonwealth. 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs &middot; Flinders &middot; NAT</small>

-- While not proposing to follow the honorable member for Melbourne  **(Dr. Maloney)**  in the remarks he has made concerning this capital city, I wish to make it perfectly clear that I entirely dissociate myself from everything he has said regarding the Chief Commissioner,  **Sir John**  Butters. When the history of Canberra, to which the honorable member referred, comes to be written, it will not be condemnatory of the work of  **Sir John**  Butters, but will, I am sure, commend him for the success with which he carried out a difficult task during the early days of establishing the Federal Capital. 

The honorable member for Wimmera  **(Mr. Stewart)**  said that he was informed by some one who attended a party meeting this morning that the date of the election had been announced. 

##### Mr Stewart:

-- I did not say by some one who had attended a party meeting ; I said that I was informed that the question was raised at that meeting. 

##### Mr BRUCE:

-- The honorable member's statement . obviously left the impression that the information was obtained from some one who had attended the party meeting, but his information on that point was as inaccurate as  most  of the information that is mere current gossip. It is not true that I indicated the date on which the election is to he held. 

##### Mr Stewart:

-- Did the right honorable gentleman mention any date? 

##### Mr BRUCE:

-- -No. It is also untrue that it is quite obvious that a date has already been fixed, as suggested by the honorable member for Reid  **(Mr. Coleman).**  As I received a reply only today from  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral to the advice I had tendered to  His Excellency  there has not been sufficient time to decide when the election can be held. There is no justification for the suggestion that the Government possesses this information, and is keeping it secret for its political advantage. 

##### Mr Coleman:

-- Can the right honorable gentleman give the date on which the House will be dissolved? 

##### Mr BRUCE:

-- I cannot. There are a number of matters to be dealt with before a dissolution can take place. For example, if the House were dissolved before the Royal Assent were given to all the measures passed by Parliament, they would not become law. When the date is fixed the fullest publicity will be given to it. 

The honorable member for Wimmera asked what wireless broadcasting facilities would be made available during the forthcoming campaign. The honorable member for Maribyrnong  **(Mr. Fenton)**  suggested that it would be desirable to appoint a committee to determine the extent to which wireless should be used by the leaders of parties. Such a suggestion is quite impracticable. The only basis upon which arrangements can be made is that of according' equal facilities to all parties. I venture to suggest that no exception could be taken by the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Scullin)**  to the arrangements adopted during the last election campaign, when the same facilities were extended to the leaders of all parties. 

##### Mr Theodore:

--  Did not the right honorable gentleman broadcast twice from Sydney? 

##### Mr BRUCE:

-- Identical arrangements were made for the leaders of all parties. I am under the impression that the leaders of the parties had an all- Australia broadcasting, in connexion with which the land lines were made available, and, in addition, were entitled to broadcast once in each State. The arrangements made for the leaders of all parties were identical, and that will be the course adopted during the forthcoming election. I have no knowledge of my speeches being broadcast twice as suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; but the only way in which that could have happened was under the arrangement I have mentioned. There was no distinction made between party leaders. 

##### Mr Gibson:

--  None whatever. 

##### Mr BRUCE:

-- The basis upon which broadcasting will be conducted in connexion with the forthcoming campaign will be the giving of equal facilities to party leaders. There would be the greatest difficulty in making broadcasting facilities available to individuals, as it would be almost impossible to determine which individuals constitute a party. 

##### Mr Stewart:

--  What has the right honorable gentleman to say concerning my suggestion that the right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes),**  as mover of the amendment, should have the right to broadcast ? 

##### Mr BRUCE:

-- I cannot draw any distinction between him and another private member. The strictest impartiality will be observed towards all parties. 

I share the views of the honorable member for Maribyrnong  **(Mr. Fenton)**  regarding all-night sittings, and hope that in the forthcoming Parliament it will be possible to carry on our business without sitting longer than the recognized hours. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:<br><small class="text-muted">Hon. Sir Littleton Groom</small>

--  Before putting the motion, I desire to thank the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Bruce)**  and the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Scullin)**  for their remarks about the  Chairman  of Committees and myself. I desire, also, to express appreciation of the faithful and efficient way in which the officers of  Parliament  have carried out their duties. During the period in which I have been in the chair, I have endeavoured to the best of my ability to uphold the dignity of Parliament, and to perform impartially the important duties which devolve upon me. I thank honorable members for the courtesy they have shown me, and for their readiness to submit to rulings of the Chair. The way in which our parliamentary work has been conducted will, I think, compare favorably with the proceedings in any parliament of the British Empire. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

House adjourned at 5.14 p.m., until a date and hour to be fixed by  **Mr. Speaker.**
