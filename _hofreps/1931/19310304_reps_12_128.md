##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- During the recent adjournment I received from the  Hon. E.  A. McTiernan a letter dated the 19th December, 1930, resigning his seat as member for the electoral division of Parkes, in the State of New SouthWales. On the 7th January last I issued a writ for the election of a member to serve for that division, and have received a return to that writ.

### DEATH OF MR. JOHN EDWARD WEST, M.P

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Yarra &middot; ALP</small>

.   -  As you,  **Mr. Speaker,**  have announced, since we last met,  **Mr. John**  Edward West, who represented the electoral division of East Sydney in this House, has passed from our midst. The news of his death on the 5 th February was, I am sure, received with very great regret by every member of this Parliament. Of each of us he was an esteemed and honoured colleague. Entering this Parliament in 1910, he was continuously a member until his death. From 1920 to 1925 he was a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and for many years before he entered this Parliament he was prominent in the public activities of a good citizen. In the early days of the Labour movement he was actively associated with its organization throughout Australia. The deceased gentleman was a greatly valued and honoured member of the party I have the honour to lead in this House, and was held in high regard in his constituency, which he served faithfully and well. Conscientious and enthusiastic in the discharge of his public duties, even in his failing years he insisted upon taking a full share of the work which devolves on all members during the sittings of Parliament, when he might reasonably have spared himself. He was a kindly man.  His  likeable disposition and his cheery outlook made him popular with all members of this chamber. The sympathy of this House goes out to the members of his family in the great loss they have sustained. I move - 

  >That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of the late  **Mr. John**  Edward West, member for East Sydney in the House of Representatives, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to the members of his family in their bereavement. 

##### Mr LATHAM:<br><small class="text-muted">Kooyong</small>

-- I second the motion. The late  **Mr. John**  West was highly esteemed by all members of this House and of many previous Parliaments. He was a very faithful supporter of his party, and was particularly earnest in the advocacy of principles in which he believed. Essentially good natured, his relations with other members of the House, irrespective of the parties to which they belonged, were always of the most cordial character. I join in the Prime Minister's expressions of regret at the passing of a respected colleague. 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

.- On behalf of the members of the Country party, I support the motion. The late  **Mr. West**  enjoyed the respect and esteem of members generally. He held strong views, but invariably expressed them with such moderation and restraint that he earned and retained the affection of the members of this House throughout his long association with-it. He was fortunate in that he had a very full life, and was able to continue his parliamentary work almost until the eve of his death. The members of the Country party desire to be associated with the Prime Minister's expressions of regret and sympathy with the bereaved relatives. 

##### Mr WATKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">Newcastle</small>

.- I associate myself with this motion of regret because my acquaintance with the late honorable gentleman extended further back than possibly that of any other honorable member. I can remember him when, as a young man, he was associated with the trade union movement, in advocacy of principles to which he still adhered when he became an employer of labour. He was a member of this Parliament for many years, and his quiet demeanour endeared him to all of us, but it did not prevent him from being a sturdy fighter for the principles for which he stood. By his death I have lost a life long friend and this Parliament a legislator who commended himself to the kindly feelings of all. 

Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Scullin)**  agreed to - 

  >That  **Mr. Speaker**  be requested to transmit to the members of the family of the late  **Mr. West**  the foregoing resolution together with a  copy of the speeches delivered thereon.

### DEATH OF THE HONORABLE E. K. BOWDEN

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; YARRA, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

.- I move- 

  >That this House expresses its deep regret  at  the death of the late Honorable Eric Kendall Bowden, a former member of the House of Representatives and Minister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders  its  profound sympathy  to  his widow and family in their bereavement. 

Since the House last met, the death has also occurred of one who was a member of this House for many years. I refer to the late Honorable E. K. Bowden, who passed away on the 13th February last at his residence at Parramatta. The news of his death was received with the greatest regret by all who were privileged to know him.  **Mr. Bowden**  was first elected to this Parliament in 1906, and, with just one break, he continued a member until 1929. He was Minister for Defence from 1923 to 1925, and in 1926 was  chairman  of. the select committee which inquired into the Commonwealth electoral law and procedure. Although zealous in upholding his own political beliefs, he always paid due regard and respect to the opinions of his political opponents.  His  sincerity and his zeal in the discharge of his public duties gained for him the respect of not only his fellow members in this Parliament, but also the members of the public who knew him. Personally, I feel that a good man has gone from our midst, and I am sure that the sympathy of all honorable members will be extended to his widow and family. 

##### Mr LATHAM:<br><small class="text-muted">Kooyong</small>

.- I second the motion. It is just 24 years since the late Honorable E. K. Bowden was elected to this chamber. He therefore had a long political career, during which he rendered real and valuable service to the people of Australia. Particularly useful was the work he did as Minister and as  chairman  of the select committee on electoral law and procedure, and also as a member of the Royal Commission on the Constitution. He was always on friendly terms with his fellow members, and enjoyed their esteem and respect.  Those  who knew him well feel that they have lost a valued personal friend. I associate myself with every word that the Prime Minister has uttered. 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

.- On behalf of the Country party, I support the motion made by the Prime Minister and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Latham)**  expressing the sympathy of this House with the relatives of one whose death at a comparatively early age - he was in the fifties only - is but another instance of the toll which public life, especially a strenuous public life, takes of public men. In spite of chronic ill health for many years, the late Honorable E. K. Bowden was a very active man in office and in Parliament. Unquestionably, his activities tended to shorten his life. As a colleague of his, I know that he was an assiduous worker. He was an easy man to work with, and as a constitutional student, he built up in this House a reputation which it will be hard for others to achieve. 

##### Mr ROWE:<br><small class="text-muted">Parramatta</small>

.- I  wish to associate myself with the tribute that has been paid by the previous speakers to the memory of the late Honorable E. K. Bowden. I cannot claim a long acquaintance with  **Mr. Bowden,**  but I met him frequently at social functions, and was always on friendly terms with him. As a matter of fact, since my election to this Parliament, I think those terms have been even more friendly. The Bowden family has been established in Parramatta for several generations, and the esteem in which it is held is very great. By the death of  **Mr. Bowden,**  we have lost one whose whole purpose in life was to benefit mankind. I tender my sincere sympathy to the widow and family in the irreparable loss they have sustained. 

Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Scullin)**  agreed to - 

  >That  **Mr. Speaker**  be requested to  transmit  to  **Mrs. Bowden**  the foregoing resolution together  with a copy of the speeches delivered thereon.

### DEATH OF DAME NELLIE MELBA

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Yarra &middot; ALP</small>

.- I move- 

  >That this House expresses  its  deep regret  at  the death of Dame Nellie Melba, and tenders  its  profound sympathy  to  her relatives  in  their bereavement. 

The death of Dame Nellie Melba is in the fullest sense of the word a bereavement of the nation, and  I  am sure, therefore, that it is the wish of every honorable member that this House should give expression to the loss which Australia feels. To honorable members who had the privilege of hearing Dame Nellie Melba sing, either in her prime, or in her later years, the regret that the supreme gift which was hers in such full measure can charm us no more, will be keen. Dame Nellie Melba was one of the greatest artists of the world. As she herself once said, she was born with a natural trill. But even when nature is bountiful, no artist can hope to achieve the eminence of Dame Nellie Melba without great effort. For her, as for most, the path to fame was strewn with thorns. That she surmounted her , difficulties, glorying in the struggle, is proof of the indomitable will and courage that she possessed. 

##### Mr LATHAM:<br><small class="text-muted">Kooyong</small>

.- I  second the motion. The name of Dame Nellie Melba has for many years been a household word far beyond the confines of the British Empire. By her voice and by her personality she achieved the rare distinction of winning the homage of fellow musicians, critics, and public alike. Yet, although thus acclaimed by the world, she was above all an Australian. Her music and her love for her country were unquestionably the greatest elements in an exceptionally full and vivid life. Reference, too, must be made to her generous and whole-hearted assistance to the musicians of this country. Her personal efforts smoothed the path for very many musical students. For her great-hearted enthusiasm, for her personal simplicity, and for her glorious voice, her name is loved by the people of our nation, whose sorrow at her passing is tempered with pride in the career of a great Australian. 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

.- I  associate myself with the expression of the regret of this House at the death of this great Australian Queen of Song. The reputation which she won by her voice made known in every country of the world the land from which she came, and which she loved and revered all her days. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

.- I  knew Dame Nellie Melba from the time she was a girl until she died. She was a friend of my sister. The friends of her youth admired the indomitable energy with which she pursued her studies. She began with the organ, under the tuition of the gentleman who was then the city organist of Melbourne. He,  I  believe, later married her sister. Her splendid heart and her perseverance made her the greatest singer of the world.  I  respect the memory of Dame Nellie Melba, too, for the splendid work she did during a terrible time when, as now, Australia was plagued with unemployment. She was then woman enough to write to some of her rich friends in England and America for assistance ; but the absurd persuasions of a bank manager, a schoolmaster, and another person, all of whom have since passed away, caused her to cease her efforts to secure help from that quarter. However, she personally gave great assistance to the unemployed at that time. Another thing for which we must be grateful to her is for keeping the name of Australia before the world. She was never ashamed of her country, and through her name, " Melba which was derived from Melbourne, she made Australia famous throughout the whole world. Her end was a sad one. The cause of her death is uncertain. Possibly, while in Egypt, she was infected with a germ. It is particularly sad that a woman of such energy, capacity, and goodness should have died so soon and in such a manner. Peace to her ashes ! May the memory of her divine gift, her charity, her indomitable courage, and her pride in her Australian citizenship, as well as her fine efforts to further the interests of Australia, live in the hearts of her countrymen £rv ever. 

Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Scullin)**  agreed to - 

  >That  **Mr. Speaker**  be requested to transmit to  **Mr. George**  Armstrong, the late Dame Nellie Melba's  son, the foregoing resolution together with a copy of the speeches delivered thereon.

### NEW ZEALAND EARTHQUAKE

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Yarra &middot; ALP</small>

--  *by leave*  - I  move - 

  >That this House expresses its profound regret at the tragic loss of life that occurred in consequence of the serious earthquake in the Hawkes Bay district of New Zealand on Tuesday, the 3rd February last, and tenders its heartfelt sympathy to the Government of New Zealand and to the relatives of the victims of the disaster. 

Every member of this House will desire to associate himself with this motion of sympathy with the victims of and sufferers by the recent earthquake in New Zealand. When the news of the disaster was received in Australia, a wave of sorrow spread throughout the Commonwealth. The earthquake occurred shortly after 10 o'clock on the morning of Tuesday, the 3rd February, and was felt most severely in the neighbourhood of Hawkes Bay, on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. Napier, a large and flourishing commercial centre, with a population of 20,000, was wrecked by the shock, and the earthquake was followed by fires which raged throughout the city. Similar devastation occurred in Hastings and other towns in the Hawkes Bay district. This earthquake, was by far the most destructive visitation of its kind that has been experienced in New Zealand. The loss of life, personal injury, and damage to property were very great. The people of Australia have been filled with admiration at, the prompt measures of relief taken by the Government of New Zealand, and by the local authorities.  A3  soon as news of the damage done by the earthquake was received in Australia, I despatched a message of sympathy to the Prime Minister of New Zealand on behalf of the Commonwealth Government and the people of Australia; and I also offered, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to despatch one of the ships of  His  Majesty's Australian Navy to assist in relief work. To this offer the Prime Minister of NewZealand, after ex-Dressing the thanks of his Government, replied that it was considered that the relief measures already taken were adequate. 

##### Mr LATHAM:<br><small class="text-muted">Kooyong</small>

.- I second the motion of the Prime Minister. The news of this disaster was received with horror by the whole of the people of Australia, and they feel the most intense sympathy with the people of our sister dominion in their loss and suffering. All honorable members will agree with everything that the Prime 

Minister has said, with the action that he took, and the offer he made to the New Zealand Government. 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

.- I desire to associate myself with the motion. Australia's sympathies have flowed out to New Zealand, because of this disaster. My only regret is that we have not been able to give some practical relief to allay the sufferings of the people of that dominion. 

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

.- I regret deeply the loss and suffering that have been caused to the people of New Zealand, but we must not forget that that awful devastation, apart from the unfortunate deaths which it brought about, has not been, responsible for half as much misery as there is in our beloved Australia to-day, and, in fact, throughout the world, in consequence of the cursed reign of gold. I, myself, should like the parties in this House to combine so that every effort may be made to do away with the terrible unemployment, want, and misery that are existing throughout Australia to-day. 

##### Mr SPEAKER (Hon Norman Makin:<br><small class="text-muted">HINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I desire to inform the House that immediately after the disaster I despatched the following cablegram : - 

{:#subdebate-6-0}
#### Right Honorable G. W. Forbes,

{:#subdebate-6-1}
#### Prime Minister, Wellington, New Zealand

On behalf of members House of Representatives Australia I desire to convey sincere sympathy with you and people of New Zealand in the loss of life and suffering caused by calamitous earthquake. 

Norman Makin, Speaker.  and received the following reply: - 

{:#subdebate-6-2}
#### Honorable Norman Makin, Speaker, Canberra

Government and people of New Zealand deeply appreciate kind message of sympathy in earthquake calamity from members Australian House of Representatives It will be conveyed to sufferers in stricken districts.

Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Scullin)**  agreed to - 

  >That  **Mr. Speaker**  be requested to transmit to the Prime Minister of New Zealand the foregoing resolution.

### ADJOURNMENT

{:#subdebate-7-0}
#### Death of Honorable D. N. Cameron - Adjournment to Mark Respect

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Yarra &middot; ALP</small>

--  As a mark of respect, I move - 

  >That the House do now adjourn. 

In so doing, I wish also to pay a mark of respect to an ex-member of this House who has recently died. It is not usual to refer in Parliament to the deaths of ex-members, but I think that, as we have advanced a long way since the first sittings of the Parliament, we should not forget its foundation members. One of these passed away recently, the Honorable Donald Norman Cameron dying on the 17thFebruary last. Few members now present were associated with him in Parliament; only three in this chamber were his colleagues. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the general election of 1901, and sat until 1903. He was out of Parliament for a year, but was re-elected in 1904, and sat until 1906. On behalf of the people of Australia, I telegraphed to his widow a message of sympathy. I am sure that all honorable members feel regret at the passing of one of the pioneers of the Commonwealth of Australia. 

##### Mr MAXWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Fawkner</small>

.- I wish to protest against the motion for the adjournment of the House, and I hope that my action, in so doing, will not be taken as evidence of any want of respect for the memory of our late colleagues. It is strange that we should seek to mark our respect by adjourning the House. Surely the postponement of the work that lies to our hand now is not to be taken as the measure of the respect in which we hold our late colleagues. Never was there greater necessity for doing away with make-beliefs, and getting to grips with the realities of a situation of unparalleled difficulty in Australia. I suggest, with bated breath, to the Right Honorable the Prime Minister and those associated with him, that any attempt to justify a course of action that, from the point of view of reason and common sense seems to me unsupportable, by saying that it has invariably been followed in the past is the most stupid kind of conservatism. We have been summoned from all parts of the Commonwealth to tackle a very difficult job ; and the sooner we get to work the better. Surely, by standing in our places as we did, and then getting on with our job, we shall pay respect in the fullest measure to the memory of our late colleagues, and at the same time conserve the interests of those who sent us here. 

##### Mr LATHAM:<br><small class="text-muted">Kooyong</small>

.- All honorable members will agree that the honorable member for Fawkner  **(Mr. Maxwell)**  has in no way shown any lack of respect for those whom we have lost. Yet, I feel that the subject he has raised is one that it is inadvisable to discuss on the floor of the House. I suggest to the Prime Minister that a small informal committee be formed with a view to seeing whether some practical means can be found of paying respect to the memory of departed colleagues and at the same time giving due regard to the exigencies of public business. 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Yarra &middot; ALP</small>

--  Some time ago the exPrime Minister  **(Mr. Bruce)**  discussed with me the subject raised this afternoon by the honorable member for Fawkner  **(Mr. Maxwell),**  and  *we*  agreed to consider, at a later date, the desirability of adjourning the House for less than a full day as a mark of respect for deceased members. We did not, however, reach finality in the matter, owing to an election taking place. I suggest that if any change is made, it should not be on a specific occasion such as the present, since that might be interpreted as exhibiting a lack of respect for the member whose death was the subject of a motion before the House. Should Parliament, in its wisdom, decide on a shorter adjournment than that which has hitherto taken place on such occasions, I . suggest that the decision be arrived at when no motion affecting the death of a member is before the House. The suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Latham)**  is a good one. I shall certainly consider the advisability of appointing a small committee, representative of all parties, to consider the question raised by the honorable member for Fawkner. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

House  adjourned at  3.35  p.m.
