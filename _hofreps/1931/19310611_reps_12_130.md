#### CANBERRA

Late Delivery of Victorian Mail - Railway Arrangements

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">BALACLAVA, VICTORIA</small>

-- Again, to-day, the Victorian mail has not been delivered in Canberra. Will the Postmaster-General make arrangements to ensure a more reliable service ? 

##### Mr A GREEN:<br><small class="text-muted">KALGOORLIE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- Owing to the heavy rains the motor car conveying the mails fromYass to Canberra was delayed, but the mails have already reached here, and a portion of them, at least, has been delivered. 

##### Mr THOMPSON:<br><small class="text-muted">NEW ENGLAND, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I ask the Minister for Transport why the New South Wales Railways  *Commissioners*  will not provide a train from Sydney to Canberra on Wednesday mornings, for the convenience of members? 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">HUME, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- I made representations on that subject to the New South Wales railway authorities, but they would not accede to my request because of the heavy loss that would be involved. 

##### Mr CROUCH:<br><small class="text-muted">CORANGAMITE, VICTORIA</small>

-- Having regard to the frequent interruption of communications between the State capital cities and Canberra, can the Prime Minister see his way to propose that the Seat of Government be transferred back to Melbourne? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">YARRA, VICTORIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- I cannot see my way to do that.

#### TARIFF SCHEDULE

Cotton Goods

##### Mr D CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BRISBANE. QLD &middot; NAT</small>

-- Will the Minister for Trade and Customs say whether any decision has been reached regarding the representations that cotton piece goods covered by item 105  *A1b*  of the tariff schedule, which had been actually shipped or ordered when the amended item was introduced on the 21st May, should be admitted at the old rate of duty? 

Mr.FORDE. - The matter has been under consideration, and I hope to let the honorable member have a written reply during the next few days.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-4-0}
#### CANADIAN TRADE TREATY

##### Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL:<br><small class="text-muted">WARRINGAH, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Can the Minister for Markets give to the House any information regarding the trade treaty between Australia and Canada, in view of the statement that the first fruit of it is the importation of 4,000,000 feet of Canadian timber? 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">HUME, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- A few days ago I signed the draft treaty in behalf of Australia, and simultaneously another copy was signed at Ottawa by the Prime Minister of Canada. As the treaty involves amendments of the tariff, honorable members will understand that I cannot disclose its details. But as soon as I receive the copy signed in Ottawa, a bill to give effect to the treaty will be introduced in this House. 

##### Mr STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA</small>

-- When will the details of the treaty be made public in Australia? 

##### Mr PARKER MOLONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">HUME, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- A copy of the treaty is now on its way to this country, and after it is to hand there should be no further delay in making it public. Until that copy has been compared with the cabled communications on the subject it is inadvisable to make public any of the details. 

##### Mr CROUCH:

-- Is the Minister for Trade and Customs  **(Mr. Forde)**  aware that a large quantity of Oregon timber is now in bond in Australia, and that importers are awaiting an anticipated reduction of duty, under the treaty that is being negotiated with Canada? Will he see that the rights of the Victorian timber growers are not prejudiced by the admission of that oregon into Australia duty free? 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; CAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND &middot; ALP</small>

-- I am not aware that the position alleged by the honorable member for Corangamite  **(Mr. Crouch)**  exists. If the honorable member will place further details before me they will receive consideration.

#### COMMONWEALTH FINANCES

Resolutions of Melbourne Conference - Conversion Loan - Reduction of Pensions - Public Service Salaries

##### Mr JAMES:<br><small class="text-muted">HUNTER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- In view of the assent by the Premiers Conference in Melbourne to the proposal that bondholders should be appealed to for voluntary subscriptions to the proposed conversion loan, and as it was the opinion of that conference that any threat of compulsion would have a bacl psychological effect, I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will undertake to apply the same principle of voluntaryism to the proposed reductions in pensions, wages, and salaries? If not, in view of the alleged necessity for securing Australian unity by " equality of sacrifice ", how can the Government justify its action in making class distinctions by according more favorable treatment to Australian money-lenders than that given to war widows, limbless soldiers, old-age and invalid pensioners, and wage-earners generally ? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The honorable member's question relates to the general financial policy of the Government, which will be announced later. 

##### Mr WARD:<br><small class="text-muted">EAST SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- In answer to questions the Prime Minister has frequently stated in this House that in no circumstances would pensions be reduced. I ask the right honorable gentleman whether the policy of the Government has been altered, and, if so, what influences have operated to bring about the change? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:

-- My reply to the honorable member for Hunter  **(Mr. James)**  applies to this question also. 

##### Mr JAMES:

-- I ask the Prime Minister - 1. Does the Government subscribe to the view that to refuse or fail to honour any contracts with bondholders would be an act of repudiation, and, therefore, dishonorable? 2. Is it not a fact that the most solemn promises were made and repeatedly re-affirmed to Australian volunteers, who enlisted for service in the world war, that those who survived, and the families and dependants of all who served, would be amply and generously provided, for during the remainder of their lives? 3. Is it contended that their present pensions are excessive; if not, are not the proposed compulsory reductions thereof a partial repudiation of those promises, and as affecting the lives and health of thousands of crippled and diseased ex-soldiers, much more dishonorable than any possible default to bondholders ? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:

-- The honorable member has not asked a question; he has merely made a propaganda speech. 

##### Mr WARD:

-- In view of the serious financial position, of the country, will the Government consider the advisability of making £500 the maximum salary to be paid to any government official or employee of the Commonwealth, including the Governor-General, justices of the High Court, Ministers, and members of Parliament ? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:

-- Consideration will be given to all practicable proposals that may be put forward. 

##### Mr JAMES:

-- Is it a fact that, knowing that the Labour caucus and the group to which I belong in this chamber cannot be expected to endorse the decision of the Premiers Conference to make wholesale reductions in wages, pensions, and maternity bonuses, the Prime Minister has invited the Opposition to come to his aid in giving effect to those proposals? In view of the fact that the reductions to which I have referred have been consistently advocated by the Nationalist and Country parties for many months, does the Government intend to facilitate the efforts of those parties to cany out a policy which is so objectionable to the members of the Labour party? 

Question not answered. 

##### Mr WARD:

-- I ask the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to make available to honorable members a comprehensive report of the proceedings of the recent Premiers Conference in Melbourne? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:

-- Yes.

#### OTTAWA ECONOMIC CONFERENCE

##### Mr D CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BRISBANE. QLD &middot; NAT</small>

-- Is the Prime Minister in a position to make a statement regarding the reported postponement until next year of the Ottawa Economic Conference? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- It was my intention to inform the House that the Commonwealth Government had made representations to the Government of Canada to the effect that it would not be convenient for it to be represented by a Minister at Ottawa in August of this year, as had been suggested, and I regret that, owing to my detention in Melbourne at the Premiers Conference, I was unable to do this, and omitted to ask the Minister in charge of Government business to do it. Prior to that I had learned that a similar reply had been sent by the Government of New Zealand. The cables on the subject that have appeared in the press state that the Government had taken this course owing to " political uncertainty ". The word " political " was not used, and I do not understand how it crept in. There is, of course, no "political uncertainty" in Australia at present. The Government felt that, because of existing conditions, it would not be convenient for it to be represented at Ottawa. It also believes that the conference would be a greater success if the proposals to be submitted to it receive more consideration in the light of recent negotiations between the respective countries concerned.

{:#subdebate-7-0}
#### DEFENCE DEPARTMENT

Use o.f Land by Unemployed. 

##### Mr LONG:<br><small class="text-muted">LANG, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I desire to address a question to the Prime Minister, which I shall preface by reading from a letter received by me this morning, as follows : - 

Sydney, 10th June, 1931. 

Dear  **Sir,** 

May I call your attention to a very urgent matter. There are hundreds of unemployed families in Sydney who realize that the chance of obtaining work is hopeless, and who are, therefore, exceedingly anxious to get a small block of land on which they can grow fruit and vegetables, keep some fowls, and perhaps a cow. It is possible to secure materials for shelters, tools, seeds, &amp;c, but the land is the difficulty. 

There is, however, at Liverpool, an area of between CO.000 and 70,000 acres belonging to the Defence Department. About 5,000 acres of this is not utilized at all for manoeuvring or big gun practice, and this is the very part which would be eminently suitable for placing families on two to five-acre blocks. I would respectfully urge you to approach the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet to get this area devoted immediately for this purpose. A value could bo fixed for the land, and this could bc paid off after a few years. The committee with which I am connected would be willing to organize the settlement if the land were available. I am confident that you will treat this as  *a*  matter of extreme urgency. 

Yours faithfully, 

Robert B. S. Hammond. 

Is it possible for the Government to cooperate with that committee by instituting an investigation with a view to effecting satisfactory arrangements for the settlement of unemployed on small blocks near Liverpool? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The Minister for Defence will reply to the question. 

##### Mr CHIFLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- The only suggestion that has been put forward by various committees with regard to. the provision of small allotments of land for the settlement of unemployed has been that the Defence Department should make available certain land at Liverpool, which was purchased for military purposes at a cost of approximately £15 an acre. It has been urged that the land should be made available to unemployed in allotments of about two acres each. After carefully considering the proposal, it was decided that the land was unsuitable for the purpose, and the request was rejected. A similar project has been considered by previous ministers for Defence, including the present Postmaster-General  **(Mr. A. Green),**  but the idea was deemed impracticable. However, the Government has offered the whole of the Liverpool Camp to the New SouthWales Government, with the exception of the hospital block, to he used for the purpose of housing the unemployed. That Government has asked the Commonwealth Government to defer the offer, as it is trying to make other temporary arrangements to house the unemployed through the medium of the Sydney Unemployment Relief Committee. Should the New South Wales Government take over the Liverpool Camp for this purpose, it is possible that it may he able to make use of a portion of the area for growing vegetables for the men in the camp.

### PRICE OP PETROL

Mr.FENTON.- Is the Prime Minister in a position to announce what the Government, acting in conjunction with the State Governments, intends to do regarding the price of petrol, and the genera] trading operations of what are known as the five major oil companies in Australia? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- On two occasions I brought up the matter at the Premiers Conference at Melbourne, during intervals when representatives were waiting forcertain reports on the financial situation. No finality was reached, but i propose to follow up the matter by further consultations with the Premiers.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-9-0}
#### GRANT OF COAL TO DESTITUTE PERSONS

##### Mr JAMES:

-- Some twelve months ago the Defence Department made available 10,000 tons of coal for the use of destitute persons in the Hunter electorate. The coal forms part of a dump at. Catherine Hill Pay, which is inaccessible except by boat. Consequently it is still there, and cannot be used by destitute persons either in the Newcastle or Hunter River districts. Will the Government make available a quantity of coal at Newcastle, or provide the services of a warship to transport the coal from Catherine Hill Bay to Newcastle, so that it may be taken to the railhead, and used as was originally intended? 

Also, will the Minister for Defence make available to the relief committees that are providing soup to the destitute in northern New South Wales, the travelling kitchens and coppers that are now stored in military buildings ? 

##### Mr CHIFLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- The 10,000 tons of coal referred to by the honorable member was under the control of the Prime Minister's Department, and the Prime Minister entrusted me with the work of making what arrangements might be necessary to enable this coal to be distributed to the unemployed. Six thousand tons were made, available from the Catherine Hill Bay stock, under the condition that the Government would not be responsible for the cost of transport. We said that if local authorities would make arrangements for transporting the coal, it would be made available. Later, it was made known to me that the coal was far away from some of the districts in which it was needed, and that the cost of transport would make it unreasonably dear. In order to meet the requirements of the Newcastle and Waratah districts a quantity of 400 tons, supplemented by a further 200 tons, was made available from the stores of my department. If the honorable member for Hunter  **(Mr. James)**  knows any council or authority which is prepared to make itself responsible for the distribution of coal, I shall consider sympathetically any application he may put before me. 

The honorable member asked whether the Government would agree to make available cooking utensils to unemployed relief committees. The Defence Department has already made available large quantities of such utensils throughout the States, including New South Wales. We made it a condition, however, that some local authority must take charge of the materia], and be responsible for it. I am not prepared to hand out public property to any one who may come along and ask for it. If the honorable member will nominate some authority which will undertake to make proper use of the material, and be responsible for it, I shall consider sympathetically any request made for its use.

#### RELIEF TO WHEAT-GROWERS

##### Mr STEWART:

-- Will the Prime Minister state whether the subject of relief payments to wheat-growers was discussed at the recent Premiers Conference, and if so, what decision was arrived at? 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The position of the wheat-growers and the farmers was discussed at the conference, as was also the position of the unemployed. The specific matter referred to by the honorable member was brought up at a meeting of the Loan Council, and in the course of a day or two the Treasurer will have a statement to make regarding it.

##### Mr BRENNAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Attorney-General &middot; BATMAN, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- Owing to the pressure of work in the Bankruptcy Office, the compilation of statistical information, other than in connexion with the annual report of the Attorney-General, can only be undertaken at the expense of other urgent work. I refer the honorable member to the annual report of the AttorneyGeneral for the year 1928-29, and to the report for 1929-30, recently circulated. These reports contain a great deal of the information as to bankruptcies, deeds of arrangement, &amp;c, asked for by the honorable member.

-- On the 21st May, . 1931, the honorable member for East Sydney  **(Mr. Ward)**  asked whether the use of sludge for top-dressing the Manuka oval would be. likely to expose people to danger of infection from tetanus. In reply, I indicated that the ground was treated with sludge residue, and that the actual top-dressing was soil and sand. In view of the apprehension expressed, I undertook that an expert opinion would be obtained on the subject. This has now been received, and indicates that there may be a danger if woundswere to become infected with bacteria from the sludge.

#### Melbourne Conference

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minis ter &middot; Yarra &middot; ALP</small>

.- I move 

That the House at its rising adjourn until Wednesday next, at 3 p.m. 

For the last three weeks the Treasurer and myself have been in attendance at a conference with the State Premiers in Melbourne, and it is desirable that the Cabinet should now have an opportunity of considering the decisions arrived at. Other honorable members will also desire time to consider those decisions and recommendations.We are facing a very grave emergency in the history of Australia. The conference to which I have alluded was representative of the seven governments of Australia, which represent various political parties, and - during the last two sittings - of the Opposition in this House and in the Senate. At this conference the position of Australia was discussed seriously and earnestly. 

It is hoped that out of those deliberations something may result which will lift Australia out of her present serious position. I would ask honorable members to reserve judgment upon what was done at that conference untilWe meet again next Wednesday, when everything will be put before the House fully and frankly, and opportunity will be given to discuss the whole situation. 

##### Mr GULLETT:<br><small class="text-muted">Henty</small>

.- For the special reasons mentioned by the right honorable the Prime Minister, I think it proper to agree to the proposed adjournment, and, therefore, support the motion. On behalf of the Opposition, I say that we shall await with the keenest interest - as, indeed, will the public of Australia - the Government'sproposal for the rehabilitation of the national finances, the revival of industry, and the reemployment of our people. May I assure the Prime Minister that it is the earnest hope of the Opposition that the Government's proposals may be of such a nature that we shall be able to give them our wholehearted support. 

##### Mr PATERSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Gippsland</small>

.- The members of the Country party offer no objection to the proposed adjournment until Wednesday, in view of the circumstances mentioned by the Prime Minister. It has been stated that representatives of the Government and of the Opposition have been in consultation in Melbourne, but I would draw the Prime Minister's attention to the fact that a not inconsiderable section of the Opposition was not consulted in any way on this occasion. We shall await with a good deal of interest the information which the Prime Minister proposes to place before us on Wednesday next. I understand that the conference which has been sitting during the last three weeks gave full consideration to proposals for the reduction of interest rates and of various forms of governmental expenditure, and I ask if any consideration was given to the possibility of reducing the cost of living by a similar reduction of tariff duties ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER (Hon Norman Makin:<br><small class="text-muted">HINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- The honorable member is going beyond the question before the Chair, which is, " That the House at its rising adjourn until Wednesday next ". The question to which the honorable member desires an answer may be submitted on the motion for the adjournment of the House. 

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Maribyrnong</small>



  >I understand that practically all the reports of the proceedings of the Premiers Conference have been printed, or, at least, that the type  has  been set up. Will the Prime Minister endeavour to supply honorable members with copies of the full report of the proceedings? If possible, honorable members should be supplied with copies before Wednesday next.

  >Question resolved in the affirmative.

#### Tariff Duties

Motion (by  **Mr. Scullin)**  proposed - 

  >That the House do now  adjourn. 

##### Mr PATERSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Gippsland</small>

.- I understand that an agreement was come to between representatives of  the  Commonwealth and State Governments at the recent conference in' Melbourne that certain percentage reductions should take place in. the expenditure incurred by the Government in paying the wages and salaries of public servants, in providing social services, and in disbursements in various other directions, while a substantial reduction in interest payments is to be brought about by means of the voluntary conversion of existing loans. 

##### Mr Scullin:

--  The whole matter can be threshed out when the subject is before the House next week. 

##### Mr PATERSON:

-- Was the question discussed at the conference of making a similar all-round reduction in customs duties, so as to assist in reducing the cost of living? 

##### Mr Scullin:

--  No. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

.- The needs of the country at the present time are desperate. Our greatest hope lies in the production of more wealth in Australia, and to induce better use of the land it is essential that we should endeavour to make the cost of all primary production as low as possible. Therefore, I urge upon the Prime Minister the necessity for doing everything possible in the direction of revising the Government's tariff policy. Only by encouraging the men on the land by lowering the tariff duties can we ensure a speedy return to prosperity. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

House  adjourned  at 3.7 p.m.
