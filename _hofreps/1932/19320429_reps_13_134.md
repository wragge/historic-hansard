### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-0-0}
#### UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF

DistributionofSurplusMilitary  Stores - Commonwealth . grant. 

##### Mr MAKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">HINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Having regard to the widespread distress amongst the unem ployed in South Australia, and the urgent need for reliefbef ore the winter, I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence when surplus military stores and clothing will be made available in the various States? 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister in charge of War Service Homes &middot; MORETON, QUEENSLAND &middot; UAP</small>

-- As part-worn and spare military clothing becomes available it is sent to applicant organizations in the various States for distribution. I shall inquire regarding the circumstances in South Australia, and let the honorable member have an early reply. 

##### Mr JAMES:<br><small class="text-muted">HUNTER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I understand that in country towns the Salvation Army will be the agent for the distribution of surplus clothing. Relief committees in the Hunter electorate' have applied to the Salvation Army for clothing, and have been informed that none is available. Will the Government see that sufficient clothing is made available to these committees for the relief of the unemployed during the winter months? 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">MORETON, QUEENSLAND &middot; NAT; UAP from 1931; LP from 1944</small>

-- As soon as it becomes available part-worn and surplus military clothing is handed over to certain charitable organizations 'which are prepared to bear the expense of distributing it. Owing to the attitude of the Government of New South Wales, which has refused to issuesuch clothing, the Commonwealth Government has arranged with the Salvation Army to distribute clothing in the country districts in that State. I regret that at the present time very little clothing is available for distribution. 

##### Mr COLLINS:<br><small class="text-muted">HUME, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I applied to the Department of Defence for clothing to be made available to the more important centres in the Hume electorate, and was advised that the Salvation Army was the approved distributing agency. When I applied to that organization for informationregarding the towns which had been supplied, I received a reply that clothing had been distributed in industrial centres only. I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence to inquire into this policy, and,  if possible, instruct that clothing be sent to country centres also. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- I shall be glad to inquire into the matter. 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; FLP; ALP from 1936</small>

-- Will the Prime Minister inform the House when the Government's proposals for the relief of unemployment will be submitted to the House ? 

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; WILMOT, TASMANIA &middot; UAP</small>

-- Probably early next week a bill to authorize the borrowing of moneys for the relief of unemployment will be introduced, andhonorable members will then have a full opportunity to discuss the matter. 

##### Mr BLAKELEY:<br><small class="text-muted">DARLING, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- The Government has announced its intention to create councils for the administration of the unemployment relief grant. Can he inform the House how those councils will be constituted ? 

##### Mr LYONS:

-- In most of the States such councils already exist, and the Commonwealth will have the right to nominate two representatives to serve on each. In New South Wales the Commonwealth Government will not be able to co-operate in that way with the State Government. As only Commonwealth money is to be expended in that State, the council to be appointed there will represent the Commonwealth alone. Probably the council will consist of five members, whose duty will be to investigate proposals for the expenditure of the grant, but the personnel has not yet been decided. 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">COWPER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Should the local governing bodies in New South Wales apply direct to the Commonwealth Governm ent? 

##### Mr LYONS:

-- We have yet to ascertain the extent of our power to make moneys available direct to local governing bodies. In the meantime these should apply to the Commonwealth Treasury. We shall ascertain whether it will be possible to follow the ordinary course of allocating the moneys to the local governing bodies through the State Government. 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:

-- Should the local governing bodies submit their own schemes to the Commonwealth Treasury? 

##### Mr LYONS:

-- Yes.

#### DISARM AMEN T

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">NORTH SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- The newspapers report that the Geneva Conference on disarmament is likely to prove abortive, and that the delegates have departed for their homes. Has the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs received any confirmation of that report ? 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">FLINDERS, VICTORIA &middot; NAT; UAP from 1931</small>

-- No.

#### CENSUS

##### Mr GABB:<br><small class="text-muted">ANGAS, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I ask the Prime Minister whether the newspaper statement that the census will be taken in 1933 has any foundation in fact? 

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- The taking of the census, particularly with a view to relieving unemployment amongst the clerical classes, is at the present time under the consideration of Cabinet. No decision has been reached.

#### PERFORMING RIGHT ASSOCIATION

##### Mr GUY:<br><small class="text-muted">BASS, TASMANIA</small>

-- In view of the desire expressed by members of all parties for a comprehensive, public inquiry into the operations of the Performing Right Association, will the Minister representing the Attorney-General bring this matter before Cabinet at an early date? 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">FLINDERS, VICTORIA &middot; NAT; UAP from 1931</small>

-- The matter is already under the consideration of the AttorneyGeneral's Department and Cabinet, and the House will be informed if any action is proposed.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-4-0}
#### REPUDIATION OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC DEBTS

##### Mr JAMES:

-- On the 27th April the Assistant Treasurer  **(Mr. Bruce)**  stated that Great Britain had never repudiated a debt to another nation. I draw his attention to the following statement published in  *The Worlds Work*  of March, 1926:- 

Greatbritainindebttoitaly

One of the by-products of the discussion of European indebtedness to America has been the discovery of repudiated debts in certain American States. No onehas so far asserted that the Federal Government has ever ignored its obligations, but particular sins of the States, especially those of the south during the reconstruction era, have been brought to our attention, especially by writers in the British press. Why should America be so harsh to Europe when we have many claims outstanding against us? 

But it appears that there is astain on the British shield as well as upon that of South Carolina and other American commonwealths. The adroit Italia n intellect has uncovered it. 

It  appears that Edward III. of England borrowed one million florins from Florence to finance his French wars, and that  the  debt has never been paid. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! On several occasions the Chair has drawn attention to the irregularity of prefacing questions by reading long extracts  from newspapers. 

Honorable members are not permitted to make comments or statements when asking questions; an irregular debate might be initiated by the reading of extracts of a propagandist nature. If honorable members must use newspaper statements as the basis of questions, such statements should be summarized as briefly as possible. 

##### Mr JAMES:

-- The statement has been made that Great Britain has never repudiated a debt, but the journal from which I have quoted has drawn attention to a debt that has never been paid. How, then, does the right honorable gentleman reconcile his statement that Great Britain has never repudiated a debt with the passage that I have quoted? It is stated that at2½ per cent. compound interest this unpaid debt has now accumulated to a sum which would liquidate Italy's debt to England, and the whole of the debts of the European nations to America. 

##### Mr Guy:

-- I submit that it is not com- petent for an honorable member to ask a question based on a newspaper report; un- less he can vouch for its accuracy. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- On that point many and varying rulings have beengiven. It is the parliamentary practice to require honorable members to vouch for the accuracy of the newspaper reports on which they base questions, but in the majority of cases, of course, it is impossible to give that assurance. 

##### Mr BRUCE:<br><small class="text-muted">FLINDERS, VICTORIA &middot; NAT; UAP from 1931</small>

-- The passage which the honorable member for Hunter  **(Mr. James)**  has just read from an American' magazine, merely confirms what I said the other night as to the honour and integrity of Great Britain. In endeavouring to show that Great Britain has acted in regard to her creditors as discreditably as certain of the American States, all the writer could do was to go back nearly 600 years to the days of Edward III., when, it is alleged, the King borrowed money from the Republic of Florence, a State which no longer exists. I remind the honorable member that there was then no " Great Britain " ; it was centuries later that the United Kingdom came into existence. It is regrettable that the honorable gentleman should try to support unfounded charges as to lack of integrity on the part of Great Britain, and give countenance to inaccurate and ludicrous statements.

#### DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

Staff Arrangements

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- Yesterday the honorable member for Richmond  **(Mr. R. Green)**  asked me whether I would lay on the table of the Library copies of recommendations or communications received from the Public Service Board in connexion with the recent rearrangement of the activities of certain Commonwealth departments, and the appointment of  **Mr. H.**  C. Brown as secretary to the new Department of the Interior. I now desire to inform the honorable member that copies of the documents in question have been placed in the Library, and copies have also been made available to the press.

-- The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follow : - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. The stations are intended to be erected in areas at present inadequately provided for, but the localities are not finally determined, as it is preferable for the department to be guided to some extent by the experience resulting from each new station brought into service.

Tasmania, and it is intended that Tasmania shall benefit immediately any funds can he made available for proceeding with the general programme.
