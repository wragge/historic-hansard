### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-0-0}
#### UNEMPLOYMENT

Christmas Relief

##### Mr BLAKELEY:<br><small class="text-muted">DARLING, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- In view of the buoyancy of Commonwealth revenues, and the extent of unemployment, will the Acting Leader of the House bring before the Cabinet the question of making available a certain sum for relief work prior to Christmas? 

##### Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL:<br><small class="text-muted">Postmaster-General &middot; WARRINGAH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-- The Prime Minister was asked a similar question during the last week or ten days, and I refer the honorable member to the answer which was then given.I shall, however, advise the right honorable gentleman of the reiteration of the request. 

##### Mr BLAKELEY:

-- Recently, in answer to a question, the Minister for the Interior stated that there was no present intention of making money available for the relief of unemployment in Canberra, but that, in his opinion, the schedule of works already provided for would furnish all the employment necessary. Has the Minister given consideration to the possibility of speeding up some of these scheduled jobs so that full-time employment may be given, between now and Christmas, to all who need it? 

##### Mr PERKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for the Interior &middot; EDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-- The matter is receiving consideration, and it is hopedthat, during the Christmas month, continuous employment will be provided from the funds already voted.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-1-0}
#### SALES TAX ON FLOUR

Mr.fENTON.- Has the Acting 

Leader of the House noticed the statement in the press by those who are qualified to judge, that the imposition of' a sales tax on flour would have the effect of increasing the price of bread by 2d. a loaf? If such action is contemplated, will the . honorable gentleman impress uponhis colleagues the necessity for the fullest consideration of the matter, soas to ascertain exactly what the effect may be upon the consumers of bread? 

##### Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- I realize the significance of the question raised by the honorable member. He may rest assured that all the possible effects of a  sales  tax on flour will be fully considered before a decision is made. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">SWAN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Will the Acting Leader of the House extend the inquiry into this matter to embrace the effect upon wheat-growers generally of that most extraordinary tariff schedule introduced by the honorable member for Maribyrnong  **(Mr. Fen ton)**  when he was Minister for Trade and Customs? 

##### Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL:

-- I think that that question may be safely left to the intelligent judgment of honorable members. 

##### Mr NAIRN:<br><small class="text-muted">PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- In the event of a sales tax being imposed on flour, will the Government consider having an inquiry made by royal commission, or otherwise, into the cost of bread in Australia, with particular relation to the price of wheat? 

##### Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL:

-- I am unable to give the honorable member an assurance in that respect without consulting with the Prime Minister. He may rest assured, however, that the fullest consideration will be given to every aspect of the matter, and that the interests of the consumers and of others affected will be conserved if, or when, a sales tax is imposed.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-2-0}
#### AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS TO BELGIUM

##### Mr PROWSE:<br><small class="text-muted">FORREST, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Has the Acting Leader of the House noticed in the press the serious report that reprisal tariffs are being operated by Belgium  against  the importation of Australian cereals, meat, and other primary products? What action does the Government propose to take to avert the disaster which will be caused to Australia by such a policy? 

##### Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- The Government is fully cognizant of the circumstances to which the honorable member refers, and realizes their importance. The steps taken by the Belgian Government are general in character, and are not directed solely against Australia. The position is being closely watched by the 

Government ; and, as was intimated a few days ago, representations are being made to the Belgian Government by the High Commissioner in London, with whom this Government is in constant touch.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-3-0}
#### IMPORTATION OF SHEET GLASS

##### Mr RILEY:<br><small class="text-muted">COOK, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- The Melbourne  *Star*  yesterday published the following message from Canberra: - 

  >It is believed that the Tariff Board's report will recommend modification of the ban on the importation of sheet glass from Belgium, which is thought to be the cause of the Belgian War Office refusing to take Australian frozen meat. The report will be ready in a fortnight. The Government will probably accept it as a preliminary step toward removing the serious trade difficulties. 

Are newspaper paragraphs of this nature the propaganda of importing interests, or of the  Government,  and are they designed to influence the Tariff Board and anticipate its decision? 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; BALACLAVA, VICTORIA &middot; UAP</small>

-- I have not seen the press paragraph to which the honorable member has referred, but I thank him for directing my attention to it. I assure him, and the House generally, that it is nothing but pure speculation. I cannot say by whom it is inspired. No such statement  has been made by the Government. The Tariff Board has completed its investigation of the glass industry in Sydney and Melbourne, and its report is expected shortly. When it is received, the Government will consider what action shall be taken upon it.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-4-0}
#### PAY OF DEFENCE FORCES

##### Mr JOHN LAWSON:<br><small class="text-muted">MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-- Is it a fact that, after due consideration, the Government has decided to increase the pay of members of the different arms of defence, as well as of workers in munition and harness factories? 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister in charge of War Service Homes &middot; MORETON, QUEENSLAND &middot; UAP</small>

-- In connexion with the Financial Emergency Act, a committee was appointed to advise the Minister on this matter. That committee has made certain recommendations, which the Minister is now considering. A statement of the Government's intentions will  be  made at a later date.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-5-0}
#### FIRING PRACTICE

##### Mr E J HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP; LP from 1944</small>

-- In view of the wholesale destruction of property, and the grave disabilities suffered by residents of Vaucluse iu the past, due to the firing of the gun at Signal Hill, will the Assistant Minister for Defence postpone the proposed firing practice which, I understand, is to be held on the 8th November, to allow a deputation to state a case on behalf of those sorelyafflicted residents, who, I believe, oan make a suggestion that would materially contribute to their relief? 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- I cannot allow to pass unchallenged the suggestion  that  there has been wholesale destruction of property; that is not borne out by the facta. Such an important port as Sydney must be adequately defended, and that is not possible unless gunnery practice is given. However, I shall be pleased to place the representations of the honorable member before the Minister for Defence.

#### TRADE COMMISSIONERS IN THE EAST

##### Mr RILEY:

-- Is the -Minister for Commerce yet in a position to make an announcement regarding the appointment of trade commissioners in the East ? 

##### Mr STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Commerce &middot; PARRAMATTA, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-- Many applications for the position of trade commissioners have been received, but no progress in the direction of making appointments can be made until the enabling legislation, which will afford honorable members ample opportunity to discuss every phase of the matter, has been placed before this House.

#### UNLAWFUL ASSOCIATIONS

##### Mr JENNINGS:<br><small class="text-muted">SOUTH SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Can the Acting Leader of the House state whether the New South Wales Government proposes to introduce legislation designed to effect co-operation with the Commonwealth Government in the policing of the Crimes Act in relation to unlawful associations and communistic propaganda? v 

##### Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- I have no knowledge of any intention on the part of the New South Wales Government to introduce specific legislation along the lines suggested by the honorable member; but I do know that the 

Attorney-General's Department of the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales co-operate fully at all times in the enforcement of the law relating to this most important matter. I assure the honorable member that that cooperation will be maintained in the future.

#### DRY BATTERIES

##### Mr PATERSON:<br><small class="text-muted">GIPPSLAND, VICTORIA</small>

-- Will the Minister for Trade and Customs say if, and when, the Government proposes to implement the report of the Tariff Board on dry batteries, which was presented last April? 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- The honorable gentleman will no doubt remember that when the item dealing with dry batteries was before this chamber, it was agreed that it should be referred back to the Tariff Board for further consideration. That action was taken. Delay has occurred because further information was required from Great Britain. The board is obtaining particulars from the British Trade Commissioner and other sources, and its inquiry will be held next January. As soon as the report of the board is received by the Government, the matter will be finally dealt with.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-10-0}
#### INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT

Russian Exports

##### Mr HAWKER:<br><small class="text-muted">WAKEFIELD, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Can the Minister for Commerce inform the House of the approximate provision made by the International Wheat Conference for the export of Russian wheat this year, when allocating the 560,000,000 bushels which the conference estimated would be the maximum requirements of importing countries? Can the honorable gentleman also' say whether, in the subsequent negotiations provided for by the agreement, any progress was made towards the fixing of a definite figure for Russian exports, and if those exports to date have exceeded or fallen short of the quantity stipulated ? 

##### Mr STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- In the original proposals, no specific figure was mentioned regarding Russia, that matter being left for subsequent negotiations between Russia and the other signatories to the agreement. The latest advice is that the extent to which Russia shall participate in the export of wheat will be finalized at the November meeting of the standing committee appointed by the conference. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">WEST SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Last week I asked the Minister for Commerce whether he was aware of reports which had appeared in the British press regarding negotiations between Russia and the other wheat-exporting countries, in regard to the international agreement for the restriction of exports, and the Minister said that he would look into the matter. Is he yet able to say whether any information has been received from Australia's representative at the conference on this subject? 

##### Mr STEWART:

-- I have no further information beyond the fact that the degree of Russia's participation in the agreement will be determined at the meeting of the committee appointed by the conference. This meeting is to be held on the 27th November. 

##### Mr HAWKER:

-- Are we to understand that the Wheat Conference, when allocating the importing countries' requirements of 560,000,000 bushels, among the countries which have wheat to export, did so without taking possible Russian exports into consideration; and are we to assume, therefore, that any exports from Russia will represent a surplus over and above the requirements of the importing countries? 

##### Mr STEWART:

-- The conference, after making specific allocations to the major wheat-exporting countries, provided for a quantity of about 46,000,000 bushels to be supplied by other exporting countries, including Russia. The allocation of that 46,000,000 bushels is now awaiting determination. 

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">MARIBYRNONG, VICTORIA</small>

-- Has the Minister for Commerce noticed in the press that there have recently been considerable importations of Russian wheat into Great Britain? Has the Commonwealth Government no power, through its High Commissioner, to protest against this breach of the agreement? 

##### Mr STEWART:

-- If any reliable evidence is forthcoming that Russia, or any other country, is breaking the terms of the agreement, the Commonwealth Government will very quickly make the necessary representations. As I have said, the agreement provides for the export by Russia of some wheat, and we have no evidence that she is not adhering to the terms of the agreement.

  >
  >And  on  and after 1st October, 1935 - 

{: type="a" start="e"}
0. Blended whisky, distilled partly from barley malt and partly from other grain, containing not less than 25 per cent. of pure barley malt spirit (which has been separately distilled by a pot-still or similar process at a strength nut exceeding 45 per cent. over proof), the whole being matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than three years, and certified by an officer  to  be whisky so blended and matured, per proof gallon- 28s." 


 *Senate's request -* 


Insert after (5), first occurring, "Australian," and insert new paragraph: - " (2) Blended whisky, n.e.i., distilled partly from barley malt and partly from other grain, containing not less than 25 per cent. of pure barley malt spirit (which has been separately distilled by a pot-still or similar process at a strength not exceeding 45 per cent. over proof), provided that the blended whisky contains not less than 15 per cent. of Australian pure barley malt spirit and contains not more than 20 per cent. of spirit upon which import duty has been paid, the whole being matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years, and certified by an officer to be whisky so blended and matured, per proof gallon -28s." 

Insert after (5), second occurring, "Australian," and insert new paragraph: - " (2) Blended whisky, n.e.i., distilled partly from barley malt and partly from other grain, containing not less than 25 per cent. of pure barley malt spirit (which has been separately distilled by a pot-still or similar process at a strength not exceeding 45 per cent. over proof) provided that the blended whisky contains not less than 15 per cent. of Australian pure barley malt spirit and contains not more than 20 per cent. of spirit upon which import dutyhas been paid, the whole being matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than three years, and certified by an officer to be whisky so blended and matured, per proof gallon - 28s." 

Upon which  **Mr. White**  had moved - 

  >That the requested amendment be made as on and from 5th October, 1933, with the modification that the duties be reduced to 26s. 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; Balaclava &middot; UAP</small>

.- This is merely an adjustment to put into effect the budget proposals to reduce the excise duty on whisky from 28s. to 26s. a gallon. At the same time, a proposal regarding the blending of whisky is incorporated in the motion, providing for Scotch whisky to be blended with Australian whisky. The excise item requires to be altered to permit this to be done. The excise item, as now proposed, limits to 20 per cent. the quantity of imported whisky in the blend, which must also contain a minimum of 25 per cent. of barley malt whisky, of which 15 per cent. must be Australian. The purpose of the proposal is to permit distillers to blend in bond, and to pay the difference in excise when they withdraw the whisky from bond. 

Motion agreed to. 

{:#subdebate-12-1}
#### Item 2 -

  >By omitting the whole of sub-item (j) and inserting in its stead the following sub-item: - "(J) (1) Spirit for fortifying Australian wine, distilled wholly from the fresh juice of doradillo grapes, subject to regulations, per proof gallon, 10s.

  >
  >The duties imposed by this sub-item apply to the spirit whether, at the time of entry for home consumption, it is mixed or not with wine. If the spirit is mixed with wine, the quantity for duty is the total quantity of spirit which has been added to the wine less any allowance for waste, including evaporation waste, which may be prescribed by Regulations. 

The reason for amending the request is to give effect to the recent reduction of the duties on fortifying spirit for wine as provided for in the budget proposals, which reduce the duty from 9s. to 6s. 6d. per proof gallon. A further departure from the Senate's request is that provision is made in the motion for such an allowance for waste, including evaporation, as may be prescribed by regulation. It is usual with spirits to pay the duty on the quantity which is cleared for home consumption. Spirits are kept in bond until they are actually required for sale or redistribution ; and any waste, including evaporation, which occurs in bond, is not subject to the duty. 

In the case of fortifying spirits, however, although the duty is not paid until such time as the wine goes into consumption, the users of the wine are debited with the amount of the duty which would be payable on the quantity of spirit which is mixed with the wine, and, consequently, any loss due to evaporation or other waste is not only a loss of the actual spirit, but also a further loss of the duty which is charged upon it. In order to place the users of fortifying spirit on approximately the same footing as the users of other spirits, it is proposed to make an allowance of 21/2 per cent. to cover the waste. This allowance represents approximately 2d. a gallon on the spirit used. After investigating the winemaking industry in South Australia, I found that one of the obstacles to the return to better times was the high duty which had to be paid on fortifying spirit. The reduction of duty has been very well received in the wine trade, and expressions of approval have come to hand from both the wine-makers and the growers. 

##### Mr Lane:

-- What about the consumers ? 

##### Mr WHITE:

-- No doubt they will benefit too, if the remissions are passed on to them. Honorable members may remember that a deadlock occurred over the price of grapes during the last vintage; but that has now been largely overcome, the wine-growers, in most cases, having decided to pay the price approved by the Government.

#### Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 3)


 *In Committee of Ways and Means:* Consideration resumed from the 4th October  *(vide*  page 3246) on motion by  **Mr. White**  *(vide*  page 3223) - 

  >That the schedule to the Customs Tariff proposals introduced into the House of Representatives on the thirteenth day of October ... as amended in the House of Representatives subsequent to that date, be further amended as hereunder set out, 

Item 1 (a b) (Beer, porter, &amp;c.). 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Capricornia</small>

.- These alterations of duty are in accordance with those provided for in the budget. As corresponding reductions are being made in excise duties the degree of protection enjoyed by our Australian industries concerned will not be affected. The Treasurer  **(Mr. Lyons)**  has expressed the opinion that the reductions of duties now provided will lead to an increased consumption of the goods affected, and that, therefore, the revenue will not be seriously reduced. Some evidence is available to show that traders are passing on to the public by way of reduced prices the advantage of the reduced duties. If I could be assured that revenue from higher duties would be used by the Government to benefit the unemployed and invalid and old-age pensioners, I should not agree to these reductions, but we have been shown quite definitely that the Government intends to use any surplus revenue that it has to benefit wealthy taxpayers, in which circumstance, I shall not oppose these reductions. 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

.- If the Government is of the opinion that the reduction of duties in these instances will lead to the increased consumption of goods, and therefore not affect the revenue, I ask whether it will consider the application of the same principle to import duties generally, and not limit it to the goods covered by this schedule.

#### Second Reading

Motion (by  **Mr. White)**  proposed - 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

##### Mr SPEAKER (Hon G H Mackay:<br><small class="text-muted">LILLEY, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- I assure honorable members that the usual procedure is being adopted on this occasion. The schedule has already been circulated, and copies are at the moment on the table. In such circumstances it is customary to accept the schedule which is in the possession of the clerk as the one which has been circulated. Honorable members should make an endeavour to file their papers when they receive them, otherwise much additional expense will he involved in unnecessary duplication. 

##### Mr Paterson:

-- Is it not customary to have a copy of the schedule printed with the bill in addition to any that might have been circulated previously ? 

##### Mr Guy:

-- It has never been done in the history of this Parliament. 

##### Dr Earle Page:

-- Would it not be reasonable to have copies of the schedule distributed with the bill so that honorable members might know what they are doing. We are endeavouring to assist the Minister to deal expeditiously with the business of the chamber, but in return we are not receiving his co-operation. Through a misunderstanding in connexion with a matter that has already been dealt with, I have been denied an opportunity to deal with a certain subject, and I do not wish that to recur. 

##### Mr White:

-- I am having copies of the schedule circulated. They have been lying on the table in the usual place. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- It would add to the smooth working of the House if Ministers were to ensure that copies of any schedule referred to in a bill were circulated with the bill before dealing with it in the chamber. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time. 


 *In committee:* 


Clauses 1 to 4 agreed to. 

Clause 5 (Validation of collection of higher duties). 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

-- I wish to raise the whole principle of the failure of the department to refund duties which have been paid at higher rates after reductions have been approved by Parliament. The Customs Act provides that deposits shall be paid by importers, hut in actual practice they are final payments, because they are never refunded. I urge the Minister, if he has not already given the matter his attention, to endeavour to devise a scheme whereby reduced rates of duty shall apply promptly instead of remaining in abeyance, as at present, for periods which extend in some instances to two years. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

.- The special provision in clause 5 is not embodied in the Customs Tariff (No. 2) to which the House has just agreed. Will the Minister state why this provision is applied only to the Excise Tariff (No. 

2)? 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; Balaclava &middot; UAP</small>

.- The question raised by the right honorable member for Cowper  **(Dr. Earle Page)**  is a pertinent one. It relates to a practice that has been in vogue since federation. When tariff proposals are tabled containing reduced duties those duties do not become operative until the schedule is embodied in a bill and ratified by both Houses. Until that stage is reached importers are required to pay the difference between the higher rates already ratified and the lower rates still awaiting ratification. The difference is generally referred to as a deposit. No government has yet taken steps to adjust the matter. I have been giving attention to this undoubted anomaly, and shall endeavour to make some adjustment. I have already pointed out that the exchange and primage deductions more than outweigh this temporary inconvenience, which will now last only until the present schedule is ratified by the Senate. Nevertheless, even that delay should be obviated if possible. In reply to a question asked the other day by the honorable member for Calare  **(Mr. Thorby),**  I stated that, when tabling tariff proposals, I would endeavour to insert a validating clause, so that the full extent. of any reduction of duty would apply in the same way as an increase now operates when tariff resolutions are tabled. I point out to the honorable member for Swan  **(Mr. Gregory)**  that the reason why this clause is not to be found in Customs Tariff (No. 2), which has just been passed, is that no higher duties than those contained in the schedule are at present being collected. 

Clause agreed to.

### CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL (No. 2) 1933


 *In Committee of Ways and Means:* 


Motion (by  **Mr. White)**  agreed to - 

  >That, in lieu of the duties of customs which may be levied in  pursuance  of section eight of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921-1922 there be collected duties of customs in accordance with  the  following provisions :  -

  >
  >Upon the publication of the notice, there shallbe charged, collected and paid to the use of the King, for the purpose of the Commonwealth, on all goods specified in the notice and produced or manufactured in the country specified therein, a special duty ascertained as follows: -

Resolution reported. 

Standing Orders suspended. 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; Balaclava &middot; UAP</small>

--  I move - 

  >That the resolution be adopted. 

It was decided that the fourth recommendation of the Tariff Board, regarding exchange and primage, should bo embodied in the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act so as to have a specific instead of a general application towards countries with depreciated currencies. In the course of the debate in Committee of Ways and Means, the honorable member for Swan  **(Mr. Gregory),**  submitted an amendment providing that any recommendations by the Tariff Board, when proposed by the Minister for gazettal, should be treated as a regulation that must be laid on the table in both Houses, and be subject to disallowance by either House. The Government accepted the honorable member's proposal, but when it was embodied in the resolution on which the bill was founded, many complications arose. The honorable member for Swan expressed his willingness to. withdraw his, amendment, but it was found necessary that the order of the day be discharged, and a new bill submitted. There were, two main objections to the honorable member's proposal - the House might be in recess at the time of the gazettal, and anotification might be disallowed in another place. Another reason for the withdrawal of the first bill is that the amendment would apply to only one specific section of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act. 

##### Mr Paterson:

--  That is really the principal reason. 

##### Mr WHITE:

-- Yes; the Senate or the House of Representatives could reject a recommendation of the Tariff Board and the Minister relating to currency depreciation, but could not deal with a proposal relating, perhaps, to a dumping duty, a consignment duty, or to some other feature of the act. To obtain uniformity in this regard, the Government has decided to give a sympathetic consideration to an amendment inserted in the Customs Bill, which, after passing the Senate, is now waiting to be dealt with by this House. 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Capricornia</small>

.- When the proposal was made by the honorable member for Swan  **(Mr. Gregory),**  and accepted by the Minister, I remarked that I thought the Minister had acted too hurriedly, without realizing the difficulties with which his department would be confronted, and the impracticability of the whole proposal. The fact that after more mature consideration, the Minister has found it necessary to withdraw the bill shows how unwise it is to accept amendments because of anxiety to satisfy the idiosyncrasies of an honorable member. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

.- I have always contended that the other branch of the legislature should have the right to determine whether taxation imposed under the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act should continue in operation. When I gave notice of my amendment, I was under the impression that it would become part of the principal act and apply generally. I agree that when goods are imported into Australia from a country that has a depreciated currency in relation to Australian currency, the government of the day should have power to impose extra duties to ensure fair competition. My amendment, however, conferred a very small power on either chamber in comparison with the enormous power given to, the Minister under the act. When I made my suggestion, I hoped that it would be embodied in the principal act'; but as it has been found that that could not be done, I am content with the Minister's promise to amend the principal act in a way which will meet the situation. 

I have no desire to embarrass either the Minister or the Government. My contention all along has been that Parliament should have the power to disagree with the action of a Minister or a Government. When the honorable member for Capricornia  **(Mr. Forde)**  was Minister for Trade and Customs, deferred duties were imposed without any report from the Tariff Board having been obtained. 

##### Mr Forde:

-- The honorable gentleman's amendment had nothing to do with deferred duties. 

##### Mr GREGORY:

-- It was never intended that the Executive should have the power to impose deferred duties or embargoes, and I have always contended that either House of the Parliament should have the right to say that such action shall not be taken without legislative authority. I am content with the procedure adopted by the Minister, and willingly fall in with it. I shall support the bill in its present form. 

##### Mr PATERSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Gippsland</small>

-- The remarks of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Forde)**  suggest that he lias not fully grasped the reason for the withdrawal of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan  **(Mr. Gregory).** 

##### Mr Forde:

--  I am fully aware of the reasons, for the matter came before me when I was Minister. 

##### Mr PATERSON:

-- It appears that there was nothing impracticable about the amendment, but that its insertion in this bill would mean that the principle embodied in it would apply merely to that part of the act which relates to this particular resolution, whereas the Minister has promised a more comprehensive amendment. By adopting the course now proposed, the honorable member for Swan will thus obtain more than he would have obtained by his original proposal. 

##### Sir LITTLETON GROOM:<br><small class="text-muted">Darling Downs</small>

--  I have some responsibility in this matter, for it was I who pointed out to the honorable member for Swan  **(Mr. Gregory)**  that hia proposal, as framed, would embarrass the Minister and the Government, and suggested that the debate be adjourned with a view to redrafting the amendment. At the same time, I said that I was 11Ot convinced that his proposal was a wise one. I am inclined to think that the Minister accepted it without realizing its full significance. Acquiescence in the procedure now proposed will not seal member's lips when the main issue comes before us again. The procedure which has been followed hitherto should not be varied without the fullest investigation of the effect of any alteration. The Executive should be given ample powers incustoms matters to deal with any emergency which might arise. In the interests of the nation a discretionary power must be vested in the Minister. Parliament cannot be expected to deal with matters which arise from day to day in the administration of its legislation. But emergency powers should be exercised only in case of emergency, matters of policy being reserved for the decision of Parliament. In pleading for the supremacy of Parliament, the honorable member for Swan has really put forward a case for the supremacy of one House of the Parliament. 

##### Mr Gregory:

--  Only as against the Executive. 

##### Sir LITTLETON GROOM:

-- But the executive is responsible to the people; and it must be remembered that governments are made and unmade in this House, and not in the Senate. In these matters we must proceed carefully. 

##### Mr SPEAKER (Hon G H Mackay:

-- The whole of this debate is somewhat irregular. It has arisen from an explanation given by the Minister in the House. 

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Maribyrnong</small>

-- Fearing that my silence may be construed as giving consent to the arrangement made between a Minister and a private member, I wish to voice my objection to one House of the Parliamentand that the Senate - being given extreme powers in tariff matters. The honorable member for Swan  **(Mr. Gregory)**  may not be aware that in England the Treasury has greater power in tariff matters than is the case in Australia. In the Old Country there is an advisory board, which, if it finds that British industries are being unfairly assailed, can recommend to the Treasury that action be taken, whereupon the 

Treasurer may impose a duty of, say, 20 per cent. or 40 per cent. against the competing foreign product. In order to protect the revenues of this country, certain powers must reside in the Executive, which,  as  the honorable member for Darling Downs  **(Sir Littleton Groom)**  pointed out, is responsible more to this House than to the Senate. Another place should not have the power to fly in the face of the Executive without this House being consulted. I protest against the tendency of the Government to accede to requests from the Country party to the detriment of the nation. 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; Balaclava &middot; UAP</small>

.  - I appreciate the advice of the honorable member for Darling Downs  **(Sir Littleton Groom)**  to act with caution in this matter. My thanks are due to him for having pointed out the difficulty which would confront any government which tried to implement the proposal framed by the honorable member for Swan  **(Mr. Gregory).**  I wish to make it clear to the honorable members for Gippsland  **(Mr. Paterson)**  and Swan that the Government is not necessarily accepting the amendment as at present worded; it will, however, give favorable consideration to a similar provision. Another bill which has reached this House from the Senate provides that prohibitions of imports must he brought before this House within six months, but whether the Government will apply that principle throughout the whole range of the Industries Preservation Act I do not know. 

##### Mr Gregory:

--  That is what the Minister said would be done. 

##### Mr WHITE:

-- I said that it would be wrong for this regulation to apply to some industries and not to others. The Government realizes that something is needed, but it does not wish at this stage to commit itself to the details. 

Motion agreed to.

### CUSTOMS TARIFF (NEW ZEALAND PREFERENCE) AGREEMENT BILL

{:#subdebate-19-0}
#### Second Reading

Debate resumed from the 25th October, 1933  *(vide*  page 3923), on motion by  **Mr. White**  - 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Capricornia</small>

.- As I appreciate the difficulties which confronted the Government in arranging a satisfactory trade agreement between the Commonwealth and the dominion of New Zealand, I do not propose to indulge in any carping criticism. When Minister for Trade and Customs I arranged for inquiries to be made into our trade relations with New Zealand, as at that time it was evident that a feeling of distrust existed in New Zealand, largely owing to the high duties imposed some years ago upon imports from that dominion to protect Australia's primary industries. Had the Scullin Government remained in office a representative would have been sent to New Zealand to endeavour to negotiate an agreement satisfactory to both countries. The ex-Assistant Treasurer,  **Senator MassyGreene,**  who visited New Zealand, was an able representative of the Commonwealth, and in the difficult circumstances which confronted him did all that was possible in the interests of Australia. Some years ago the Government imposed a duty of 6d. per lb. on New Zealand butter, which had the indirect effect of depriving Australia's secondary industries of a substantial portion of their trade with the dominion. The embargo placed on the importation into Australia of New Zealand potatoes, together with the fact that a number of other primary products required fully 100 per cent. protection, was also responsible for the strained relations between Australia and New Zealand which undoubtedly caused a substantial falling off in our exports to New Zealand. An agreement between the two countries has now been adopted, and I consider it preferable to give concessions item by item, rather than to undermine our whole fiscal policy in a general way, as was done at Ottawa. Under articles 10 to 14 of the Ottawa agreement we have given away the rights of Parliament to increase duties on certain commodities which can now be done only on the favorable recommendation of the Tariff Board. The system adopted under this agreement is more satisfactory. As there has been a steady falling off in Australia's exports to New Zealand since the 1922 agreement was adopted, it was necessary to send a representative to New Zealand to bring about a better feeling in matters of trade between the two countries.Some years ago the late  **Mr. Pratten,**  when Minister for Trade and Customs in the Bruce-Page Administration, visited New Zealand with that object; but he found that, in consequence of the action of the Commonwealth Government in imposing an import duty of 6d. per lb. on New Zealand butter, it was impossible to come to a satisfactory arrangement Our exports to New Zealand since 1922 has been as follows: - 


<graphic href="142331193311031_11_0.jpg"></graphic>


Thus during a period of ten years they have dropped to almost one half. Of New Zealand's exports, totalling £37,000,000, approximately £32,000,000 worth are shipped to Great Britain. In these circumstances, New Zealand is anxious to maintain friendly trade relations with the Mother Country, as a first consideration, and in view of the substantial reduction of exports from Australia, does not look too kindly upon the Australian market. In 1927-28, New Zealand's imports into Australia, exclusive of bullion and specie, were valued at £2,945,000; in 1931-32 the value had decreased to £702,000, or a drop of £2,243,000 in four years. Fully 70 per cent. of our exports to New Zealand consist of secondary production and our manufacturing industries have suffered in consequence of the benefits afforded to primary industries. I do not wish it to be inferred that I am opposed to the protection given to the primary industries. I support it. It is, however, pleasing to note that even during the depression there has been an increase of certain exports to New Zealand, such as iron and steel products, the value of which increased from £12,303 in1930 to £147,178 in 1932. The other increases were - 

I trust that the present rate of export will not only he maintained hut also increase. Those engaged in the citrus fruit industry of Australia have, however, cause for complaint, because of the prohibition imposed by the New Zealand Government upon importations of citrus fruits from Australia. I was sorry to learn from the Minister's speech that  **Senator Massy-Greene's**  efforts to induce the New Zealand Government to remove the embargo were unsuccessful. 

##### Mr White:

-- The embargo was lifted as regards exports from South Australia, and we hope that that is the beginning. 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- It should have been possible to lift the embargo completely. I" hope that the Government will continue its representations with a view to having the embargo lifted:, as it means a loss of £500,000 a year to those engaged in the industry. 

##### Mr White:

-- The Government has arranged for fresh pineapples to enter NewZealand. 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- I trust that a.3 the result of this agreement Queensland producers will be able to supply a substantial proportion of tho £30,000 worth of pineapples imported to New Zealand annually. It seems to be a short-sighted policy on the part of the New Zealand Government to continue the prohibition of a large portion of Australia's exports of citrus fruits, and I hope that the embargo will soon be lifted. The New Zealand duty on Australian canned pineapples was 35 per cent., and on imports from Che Malay States 25 per cent., but Australian exports of pineapples are now to be dutiable at 25 per cent. Australia should be on a better footing in that respect.. The Minister admitted that in some instances our representative was unsuccessful in arranging for Australian imports to be dutiable at the British preferential duties. I trust that the Minister will arrange for the department to keep a record of these items, which should be the subject of further investigation and negotiation. 

##### Mr White:

-- We have an exchange advantage over Great Britain. 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- Yes, but we ought to be on the same preferential basis as Great Britain. The embargo upon citrus fruits has caused a loss of £200,000 to our external trade. The loss to the industry, based on an average of 2s. a case on 5,000,000 cases due to a glut in the local market, will amount to £500,000. The number of actual growers affected, apart from their dependent employees, is 10,593. The capital value of the orchards concerned is £7,750,000. In addition to the loss sustained by those directly engaged in the industry, the embargo also affects the following industries: Shipping, railways, timber, paper manufacturing, printing, implement makers, spraying materials, waterside workers, motor transport, box-making, fertilizers, nails and tie wire suppliers, and packing houses. 

##### Mr JOHN LAWSON:<br><small class="text-muted">MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-- Our exports of citrus fruits this year constituted a record. 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- The operation of the embargo has depressed local prices to such an extent that the Commonwealth had to make a grant of £30,000 to assist the citrus fruit-growers to secure new markets. 

##### Mr Nock:

-- Much, of the exports did not return one penny to the grower. 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- The embargo in New Zealand caused our trade to be diverted from that country to other countries, and as a result there was little or no profit to the grower on shipments; on the other hand there was a loss of about £500,000 because of depressed prices. The loss on our export trade is detrimentally affecting not only the citrus fruit industry, but also the allied industries which I have mentioned. In addition the Government's revenue will also suffer, because it will be impossible for many of the growers, especially returned soldiers who have been settled on irrigation areas, to meet their commitments. This is a large primary producing industry and I hope that the Minister will lose no time in again taking up this matter with the New Zealand Government. 

The agreement is very disappointing lo the Australian wine industry. The producers asked that Australian wines should at least be placed on the same footing as South African wines in the New Zealand market. For many years South African wines have enjoyed a preference which has been denied our wines, but fortunately the margin is not so great as it used to be. The duties on South African wines are - still wines 3s. 6d., and sparkling wines 9s. a gallon ; while the duties on Australian wines are - still wines 4s., and sparkling wines 10s. a gallon; so that South Africa enjoys preference over Australia of 6d. a gallon on still wines, and ls. a gallon on sparkling wines. The duty on Australian brandy was recently increased from 36s. to 40s. a gallon. When the Wine Export Bounty Act was passed, New Zealand threatened to impose a dumping duty on Australian wines equal to the export bounty, and as a result our exports to New Zealand were exempted from the operation of the act. 

##### Mr White:

-- In the New Zealand trade Australia has an exchange advantage over South Africa. 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- There is a small exchange advantage, but I am assured by those engaged in the wine industry that it is not sufficient to enable them to compete against South African wines. They consider that their case was not sufficiently stressed before the New Zealand Government. It has always been a sore point with Australian wine-makers that New Zealand should give a preference to South African wines, in the production of which black labour largely enters. The wine industry in New Zealand is small indeed, and will never be large owing to climatic conditions, so it cannot be said that that country has imposed duties in order to protect the local industry. Recent press cable announcements are to the effect that Great Britain has extended its trade treaty with Portugal until 1941, and, under that treaty, Empire wines cannot bear the name " Port " in Great Britain. That, of course, is a great handicap to the Australian wine industry, and it has been the subject of many representations. It is another matter in which the Minister might interest himself. 

I notice that under the treaty vacuum pumps for milking machines are to be admitted from New Zealand free of duty instead of having to pay a duty of 25 per cent, as formerly. For many years Scott and Son Proprietary Limited, of Melbourne, and seven other firms in Australia, have been producing this class of equipment. They have been exporting vacuum pumps to New Zealand and also supplying the Australian market. Now they are faced with the competition from New Zealand, where wages and other production charges are lower than in Australia. Therefore, the proposal of the Government to admit these pumps free of duty from New Zealand is most unfair. 

##### Mr White:

-- The cost of freight should counterbalance any disparity in wages. 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- The firms concerned consider that they will lose substantial business as the result of the agreement. Of course, other secondary industries in Australia will benefit from it. Some industries must be disappointed. 

I commend the agreement, but I realize it has many weaknesses. Although Australian vacuum pumps may now enter New Zealand free of duty, the lower costs there prevent Australian manufacturers from competing in that market. The Australian firms that are manufacturing these pumps have recently drawn the attention of the Customs Department to the fact that New Zealand vacuum pumps are being incorrectly admitted free of duty, because of which the tendency is for pumps made in New Zealand to be shipped to Australia. The reduction of the duty from 25 per cent, to free, will, therefore, have a serious effect on our local' industry, and the Australian firms cannot understand the reason for this further attack upon them. 

The growers of dried fruits will undoubtedly benefit under the agreement, as Queensland probably will in respect of the export of canned pineapple. New Zealand has imposed, on foreign raisins, a duty of £9 6s. 8d. a ton, which should lead to increased exports from Australia. Last year, our exports to that country were valued at £180,000, while the value of foreign imports was £70,000. It is hoped that this agreement  will enable the Australian dried fruits industry  *to*  capture a substantial proportion of that foreign trade. Dried apricots and peaches are also being placed on a favorable footing compared with similar fruit from other countries. Australia's close proximity to its sister dominion should lead to the exploitation of her market to a much greater degree. At present, South African dried fruits are admitted into New Zealand free of duty, while Australian dried fruits have been subject to a duty of 2d. perlb. That anomaly has been removed under the agreement, and my only regret is that other anomalies affecting the wine industry and citrus fruit industry have not also been removed. The industries of New Zealand are in many respects similar to our own. I realize that the agreement will meet with the criticism of certain secondary industries of our sister dominion, because of competition from Australia, but, on the other hand, there is bound to be criticism in Australia in respect of other aspects of the agreement. It should be the aim of whatever government is in power to promote the most friendly relations between Australia and New Zealand. The two countries have much in common, and it is essential that they should act in close co-operation in order to safeguard their position in the Pacific. 

##### Mr PATERSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Gippsland</small>

-- I welcome this agreement which is an extension of, and perhaps some improvement upon, previous agreements with New Zealand. I realize that tremendous difficulties faced this Government in attempting to negotiate an agreement of this kind, particularly with a country the products of which are in most cases very similar to our own. As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Forde)**  has said, New Zealand is geographically in close proximity to Australia; in fact, it is a great deal nearer to the eastern States than is Western Australia. For that reason, it is only natural that we should trade with each other as freely as possible. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition referred to the production of butter in Australia, and said that our attitude with regard to New Zealand butter had raised difficulties between the two countries. At the present time, New Zealand would gain nothing by having free access to this country's ports in respect of its butter. There was a time some years ago when Australia exported butter only during a comparatively small part of the year, and when we were short of supplies this market was of some advantage to New Zealand. That position does not obtain now, because throughout the whole of the year we are exporting butter from one State or another. If our ports were open to New Zealand butter, for every box imported here an additional box of our own production would have to be exported to compete with New Zealand butter overseas. Therefore, it would really be of no advantage to New Zealand to sell butter in this country. It would be like taking coals to Newcastle. It seems to me that the principal advantage which we are conferring upon New Zealand is the concession of entire exemption from primage duty. I suppose that primage was one of the few things which the Government had to bargain with, and I am glad that it has granted this concession. We have really gone a little further with New Zealand than we have with Great Britain, inasmuch as we have only reduced the primage on British goods from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent., whereas we have wiped out primage altogether so far as New Zealand goods are concerned. The list of New Zealand goods with respect to which some concession has been granted is much longer than the list of Australian goods on which New Zealand has given some preference; but, on the other hand, among the list of New Zealand goods involving concessions are many items in connexion with which no importations take place. 

##### Mr Scullin:

--  That might encourage importations. 

##### Mr PATERSON:

-- It might lead to some increase of trade. Specified items enter both countries at the concession rates set out in the schedule, and, we are told, all items which are not specified have the advantage of entry to both countries at British preferential rates. No alteration can be made of the specified items at specified rates without six month's notice. As regards the unspecified items which, in both countries, enjoy the advantage of the British preferential rate, the duties maybe altered without notice. We simply impose on imports of those items from New Zealand whatever happens to be the British preferential rate in our tariff, in accordance with any variation which may be made from time to time. 

I am particularly pleased that we have secured concessions for the marketing of Australian dried fruits in New Zealand, and I should like to know whether the word "raisins" covers sultanas as well as lexias. 

Mr.White.  -  Yes. 

##### Mr PATERSON:

-- This concession will be of great advantage to the Australian dried fruits industry. New Zealand has agreed to impose a duty of1d. per lb. on foreign raisins, while the Australian product will be admitted duty free. Hitherto, in the dominion market, our growers have had to meet on even terms competition from California, Greece, Turkey and other countries where production costs are much lower. Now, with an advantage over foreign competitors of1d. alb., our trade in dried fruits with the sister dominion should increase substantially. There has been a remarkable development in this industry during recent years, due largely to action taken by State governments to put returned soldiers on suitable areas for the production of this class of fruit. In 1919 the Australian production of sultanas totalled about 14,000 tons, and as the local market absorbed 12,000 tons, the exportable surplus was only about 2,000 tons. To-day we are producing between 70,000 and 80,000 tons, and as the Australian market absorbs only about 13,000 tons, the surplus available for export is approximately 60,000 tons. The preference now given to Australia by New Zealand will be of real value to us, following as it does the generous preference given by Canada to us, and the more recently granted concession by Great Britain. I hope that this agreement will lead to a substantial increase of trade between Australia and New Zealand and also to a better understanding between the two dominions. 

##### Mr HAWKER:<br><small class="text-muted">Wakefield</small>

.- I support the motion and also congratulate the Government, and particularly the former Assistant Treasurer  **(Senator Massy-Greene),**  for having made this trade agreement with New Zealand. The treaty in itself does not indicate much progress towards the extension of reciprocal trade, but it is of great value in that it prevents the drifting apart in trade relations of the Commonwealth and the dominion. Reciprocal trade arrangements are always extremely difficult to make, particularly between countries producing similar classes of goods. That is one reason why some trouble has been experienced in making this treaty between Australia and New Zealand. As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition (Mr.Forde) has pointed out, the exclusion from the Australian market of New Zealand butter and potatoes has done something to mar the good understanding which should exist between British dominions in the Pacific. That state of affairs was, of course, most regrettable because we must all realize the necessity for British peoples in this part of the world coming closer together to maintain their own standards. It is, therefore, very gratifying to know that, there is now a better understanding between Australia and New Zealand, and that at last we have been able to persuade New Zealanders that, as regards the principal products of both countries, each can expect to retain its market for local producers and that, as regards other products, each country will give to the other the fullest possi ble measure of preference. Australia, being to some extent an industrialized country, has a much wider scope for exporting to New Zealand than New Zealand has for exporting to Australia. It is only in respect of a few luxury products that, so far as I can glean from the schedule, it is possible for Australia to give New Zealand substantial concessions. First on the list of these is preference in the Australian tariff to New Zealand Stilton cheese, which, in future, will be duty free, as against a former tariff of 6d. perlb. New Zealand produces excellent Stilton cheese which is in much favour with those who have acquired a taste for it. Another item is Toheroa soup. It is in respect of items of this sort that Australia can satisfy the requirements of epicures with products from New Zealand rather than with chowder from the United States of America and other foreign countries. Apart from the limited number of items of this sort, the other really major concessions given by Australia to New Zealand are the exemption from sales tax of New Zealand products which compete with Australian products that are on the exempted list - this concession, I feel sure, is much valued by New Zealand, and is one which it  is  well worth while for Australia to make - and the removal of primage duty from New Zealand goods, a concession which Australia can well afford to make, and which will he of genuine benefit to New Zealand. On the other hand, by far the greatest concession to Australian trade is the general benefit that Australian manufacturers and certain other Australian exporters will derive from the undertaking, on the part of New Zealand, not to impose dumping duties or exchange adjustments which would affect Australian trade adversely, as against British trade with the sister dominion. The fact that it is a concession in relation to something which does not exist at the moment does not in any way detract from its value to Australian trade. 

An outstandingly important concession to Australia is the imposition by New Zealand of a duty of1d. per lb. upon foreign dried fruits. This should secure to Australian producers the bulk of that part of the New Zealand market which, hitherto, has been supplied by the United States of America. 

##### Mr Nock:

--  Does that concession apply to other dried fruits ? 

##### Mr HAWKER:

-- Yes. The secretary of the Australian DriedFruits Association has informed me that, because of the difficult position confronting the dried fruits industry at the present time, the association welcomes the treaty, which will be particularly valuable, not only to the producers of sultanas, but also to the producers of dried tree fruits, such as apricots, grapes, nectarines, peaches, plums, &amp;c. 

Every extension of a sheltered market is of value to the dried fruits industry out of all proportion to the apparent figure of the extent of the new market. The dried fruits industry has a particu larly complete marketing organization. If the export of Australian dried fruits is assured at a fair price to a sheltered market, such  as  Canada, New Zealand, or the Mother Country, the industry can make its marketing arrangements ahead, with the result that it is required to sell, on the world's market at the best price offering, only a limited proportion of its crop. In some years they may be supplying these sheltered markets at a lower price than is ruling in the outside unsheltered market; but the organization of the industry is strong enough to take the long view that the assured or sheltered market, which has been given to it by substantial preferences, is of more value, and should be kept supplied even at the cost of some temporary profit which may be obtainable for a short period in the outside market. I again congratulate the Government on having made this trade agreement, and I commend the bill to the favorable consideration of honorable  members.

##### Dr MALONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Melbourne</small>

.- It gives me pleasure to be privileged to witness this gesture of goodwill between the dominions of Australia and New Zealand, and I hope that it will be repeated in every possible way. I look back to a largely attended meeting that, 44 years ago, was held in the Melbourne Town Hall, under the auspices of the Australian Natives Association, to advance the claims of Western Australia to the rights of self-government. The  chairman  was  **Mr. Purvis,**  a well-known Victorian lawyer of that day. In a speech that I made, I likened the five mainlandStates of Australia to the Southern Cross constellation, and Tasmania and New Zealand to the " two pointers," to that astral group. I believe that that was the first occasion upon which that simile had been employed. Australians and New Zealanders speak the one language, and are of the same parentage. I should like the friendly relations of the two dominions to go so far as to embrace the minting of similar coinage. Such a bond would be beneficial to future generations. New Zealand is perhaps more bountifully endowed by nature than any country other than Japan. The Japanese people are more artistically inclined, and improve their landscapes and seascapes with beautiful designs of plant growth, and in other ways. Both New Zealand and Japan have hot springs, but the famous pink and white terraces of our sister dominion .are buried 80 feet below the surface of the soil, whereas those of Japan are still visible. I should like Australia and New Zealand to unite in the firmest bonds of friendship. Slight differences sometimes become big rifts, which frequently are subjected to the arbitrament of war. In the matter of defence wc should be so united that no important change of policy would be made by either without consulting the other. I have been informed on the most reliable authority that, when a vessel from Australia is due to arrive in the port of Auckland, some hotels, but particularly one of them, display notices warning their habitues to be watchful. That is almost inconceivable. I hope that the time is not far distant when the hands of Australia and New Zealand will be so firmly clasped, that the knuckles will whiten in the grip. 

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Maribyrnong</small>

-- It is a pleasure to find Australia and New Zealand being drawn closer together by this trade treaty and in other ways. Three years ago, I met in Auckland, a Minister in the New Zealand Government, and discussed with him the question of reciprocal trade. Although that conference lasted only two and onehalf hours,. I was convinced that considerable antagonism towards Australia existed in New Zealand, on account of action by Australian governments against Dominion products, principally butter. Victorians will remember distinctly that 

On  one occasion a shortage of butter supplies, due to drought conditions, led to the importation of a large quantity from New Zealand to make good the deficiency, and the imposition of a duty of 6d. per lb. on New Zealand butter when it was sought to continue the practice was regarded as a distinct rebuff. That feeling, however, was gradually smoothed away. I urged the promotion pf a better understanding, the frequent interchange of views, and, if possible, the making of a trade agreement. I realize that any agreement must be somewhat difficult to operate. Already, in certain quarters in Australia, the complaint has been voiced that the competition under this agreement will be fairly lively. There must, however, be give and take, and I am not prepared at the present juncture to take up the cudgels on behalf of any Australian industry in opposition to the ratification of the agreement by this Parliament. But if it be correct, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Forde)**  has asserted, that in respect of some commodities South Africa enjoys greater preference than Australia in New Zealand markets, that anomaly ought to be removed. Many Australians have made a permanent home in New Zealand, and these two dominions are more closely knit than are any other portions of the British Empire. I pay my meed of praise to  **Senator Massy-Greene**  for having consummated such an admirable arrangement as that which we are now considering. Some readjustments may be found necessary, but 1 have no doubt that they would readily be sanctioned by this Parliament. I am rather sorry that New Zealand withdrew from the Australasian conventions, for at one time it seemed likely that New Zealand would enter the Australian federation. I regret that New Zealanders are not represented in this Parliament, The people of the two dominions are one in their aims and aspirations, and there must be unity of action by them in the settlement of questions of mutual concern. It is pleasing to note that a number of New Zealand cadets are being given training at our naval college, and that the visit of our warships to New Zealand was greatly appreciated by that Dominion. 

##### Mr NOCK:<br><small class="text-muted">Riverina</small>

.- I join with other honorable members in supporting the ratification of this reciprocal agreement, and I am pleased that further facilities are to be provided for the admission of Australian goods into the Dominion of New Zealand. I regret that the Government has not been able to secure the complete removal of the embargo on oranges. It has been partly removed so far as South Australia is concerned, but the provision might quite well have been extended to the Murrum - bidgee irrigation area, which is practi- cally isolated from other fruit-growing districts. Fruit from outside, secondhand fruit cases and seedlings are all excluded from that area. Every possible precaution is taken to prevent the introduction of disease, and an official certificate could be given to show that the. area is free from fruit fly, the pest that is so much dreaded by the New Zealand growers. I feel sure that the failure of the Government to secure the complete removal of the embargo on citrus fruits is largely due to the fact that no satisfactory arrangement was come to with the New Zealand Government for the admission of New Zealand potatoes to the Sydney market. It has been said that the quantity of oranges exported this year from Australia is greater than during any previous year. That may be so; but the growers have notnecessarily benefited as a result. Consignments of oranges have been sent to England, but the price received has been so low that the growers have not received in return even as much as1d. a case for the fruit which they have picked, packed and exported. The entire return on the fruit has been swallowed up in freight, transport and selling charges. This merely demonstrates how important to Australia is the New Zealand market. Not only the citrus-growers are affected, but also the growers of cherries and other fruits. In the past large quantities of water melons used to be sent to New Zealand every year, but at the present time there seems to bo an embargo on the entry of all Australian fruit and vegetables into New Zealand. I observe that Australia is to receive some advantage in regard to raisins on the New Zealandmarket, as well as in respect of pineapples, prunes and other dried fruits. I hope that the Government will continue to negotiate with the New Zealand Government with a view to obtaining still further concessions and securing the removal of the orange embargo.

### NORTHERN TERRITORY (ADMINISTRATION) BILL

#### Second Reading

##### Mr PERKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">Monaro- Minis ter for the Interior &middot; Eden &middot; UAP</small>

-- I move - 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

When the Northern Australia Act 1926 was in force, the North Australia Commission performed certain functions and duties particularly connected with development in North Australia, and a government resident had charge of the general administration. Provision was made in the Northern Australia Act for officers appointed by the North Australia Commission from the Public Service or Railway Service of the Commonwealth or a State, and from the Public Service of the Northern Territory to retain their existing and accruing rights, but no provision was made in that act for the preservation of the rights of a person within the categories mentioned appointed to the position of Government Resident. Colonel R. H. Weddell, the present Administrator of the Northern Territory, was appointed to the position of Government Resident of North Australia under the Northern Australia Act. Prior to his appointment, he was an officer of the Commonwealth Public Service. Owing to the fact that there was no provision in the Northern Australia Act for the preservation of the rights of an officer appointed to the position of Government Resident, Colonel Weddell has lost all his existing and accruing rights as an officer of the Commonwealth Public Service. When it is considered that the rights of junior officers appointed by the North Australia Commission were preserved, it is anomalous that Colonel Weddell's rights should not also be preserved. The object of this bill is to restore to Colonel Weddell the rights as a Commonwealth officer which he lost when appointed to the position of Government Resident of North Australia. It will be observed that the bill has been made retrospective to the date of commencement of the Northern Territory Administration Act 1931, or in other words, from the date of repeal of the Northern Australia Act. 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Capricornia</small>

.- I have not studied the provisions of this  bill, but as I am assured by the Minister that it contains nothing contentious, I offer no objection to its immediate passage. 

Question resolved in the affirmative.

### OFFICERS' RIGHTS DECLARATION BILL

{:#subdebate-24-0}
#### Second Reading

##### Mr PERKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">Monaro- Minister for the Interior &middot; Eden &middot; UAP</small>

--  I move - 

  >That  the bill be  now  read a second time. 

Various acts of Parliament make provision for the preservation or retention by officers of their existing and accruing rights. The Officers' Rights Declaration Act 1928, defines the rights which are preserved or retained by officers. The act applies to the acts and sections thereof mentioned in the schedule. The object of this bill is to add to the schedule of the Officers' Rights Declaration Act 1928, the words " Northern Territory (Administration) Act, 1910-1933, sections 17, 17a and 17b." Section 17 of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act provides for the transfer to the Public Service of the Northern Territory of all officers of the Public Services of North Australia and Central Australia, and for the preservation of the existing and accruing rights of such officers. Section 17a of the Northern Territory Administration Act provides for the retention of existing and accruing rights by members of the North Australia Commission or officers of that commission who were continued in the service of the Northern Territory after the abolition of the commission. None of the members of the commission was continued in service, but a few officers of the commission were retained. Section 17b of the Northern Territory Administration Act provides for the retention of existing and accruing rights by the officer appointed to the position of Government Resident of North Australia. This section was placed in the act by thebill to amend the Northern Territory Administration Act which has just been passed. 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Capricornia</small>

.- As this bill deals with non-contentious matters, I shall not delay its passage by asking for the adjournment of the debate. 

##### Mr A GREEN:<br><small class="text-muted">KALGOORLIE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

.- I should like to know whether the Government can make provision in this bill for members of theCommonwealth Public Service engaged in the Northern Territory to obtain transfers at regular periods to positions in the south. In the past, these officers have had considerable difficulty in getting away from the severe climate of the north to the more agreeable climate of the southern States. The tendency has been to regard those who live on the coast in the more temperate parts of Australia as "coast guards " who resort to every subterfuge to avoid being transferred to remote districts. As a result, those serving in remote and uncongenial areas are continued in this form of exile year after year. 

##### Mr PERKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">Monaro- Minister for the Interior &middot; Eden &middot; UAP</small>

--  No provision is made in the bill to meet the circumstances mentioned by the honorable member, but I agree that some such change as he has suggested will eventually have to be made. Frequently, when a man joins the Service, and is sent to a remotely situated district, he is left there for the  rest  of his life. Already an endeavour is being made to bring about an interchange of police officers between Canberra and the Northern Territory. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time, and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted.

### ADJOURNMENT

Cornflour  -  Military Band for Broadcasting -Christmas Unemployment Relief  -  Sales Tax Administration - Education by Correspondence - Bangalow Post Office  -  Repatriation : Soldiers' Dependants : Reduction of Pension  -  Death of E. L. Kelly. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Archdale**  Parkhill) proposed - 

  >That the House do now adjourn. 

##### Mr FENTON:<br><small class="text-muted">Maribyrnong</small>

.- The following paragraph, which is taken from a letter written by Clifford, Love  and Company, places in a better light statements that were made by certain honorable members last week on the subject of cornflour. It reads - 

  >We are the proprietors and owners of the name of Brown and Poison in Australasia, having paid for the rights and interests of same in good hard cash. You also stated that Brown and Poison's cornflour was quoted in the  *Australasian Grocer*  at the retail price of 8d. per lb. Brown and Poison's cornflour can be bought in most retail shops in Melbourne, Victoria; Adelaide, South Australia; Perth, Western "Australia; and Tasmania at 7d. per lb., and in some instances as low as per lb. There is no price arrangement made with the Scottish firm and therefore this statement is also not correct.. 

The following paragraph proves that the wages paid in Australia compare favorably with those which obtain overseas: - 

  >In New South Wales employees in the cornflour industry are paid a living wage. Does the Government wish these people reduced to the level of the black coolie? The award rates in New South Wales range from £&lt;! 14s. to £3 18s. per week, but manufacturers pay £4 4s. and to tub-men  *£4*  9s. per week. Are they to be condemned for doing this? 

In justice to that company and the industry generally, I think it only right to point out that the figures which were quoted by honorable members in opposition to a reduction of duty are correct, and that cornflour is sold in Australia for as little as 5d. per lb. 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Yarra</small>

.- Some weeks ago, I and other honorable members waited on the Postmaster-General  **(Mr. Parkhill)**  to protest against a proposal by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to bring a British military band to Australia as we believe that many highly qualified musicians in this country are out of work. I now learn from the press that it is the intention of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to form an Australian military band. I am very glad of that, for at no other time has there been greater need to give practical encouragement to Australian musicians. 

##### Mr STACEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Adelaide</small>

.- As Christmas 'is approaching, and there are many unemployed in Australia, the position being particularly acute in South Australia, I urge the Postmaster-General  **(Mr. Parkhill)**  and the Minister for the Interior  **(Mr. Perkins)**  to arrange that portion of the profits made by the Postmaster-General's Department shall be appropriated for the purpose of renovating the Adelaide post office, which is in a sad state of disrepair. I point out that at least 50 per cent, of the expenditure would be for labour. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">West Sydney</small>

-- I take the opportunity of urging the Acting Leader of the House  **(Mr. Parkhill)**  to forward a request to the Loan Council, now in session in Melbourne, to supplement the efforts that are being made by State Governments to provide extra relief employment before Christmas. The matter has been brought forward by other honorable members at question time, and it was referred to this morning by the honorable member for Darling  **(Mr. Blakeley)**  who sought information in respect to the provision of relief for the unemployed in Canberra. For a couple of weeks I have been considering whether I should move the adjournment of the House, in order that representative members might express themselves on the subject, and urge the Commonwealth Government to take the necessary action. Previous Governments have made special arrangements to provide additional employment, prior to Christmas time. I may be told that this Government has provided a sum of money in the Estimates for additions, new works, and buildings, which will absorb many of the unemployed, but these votes are more or less earmarked, and are not likely to be expended immediately. For instance, one projected undertaking is the building of a sloop in Australia, but some time must elapse before this and other public works can be commenced. The various State authorities are providing relief work on a ration basis, and in some cases men work for food alone. It is most desirable that the Commonwealth Government should directly supplement the funds of the States, so that more constant employment may be given. I do not intend to labour this matter, because I am sure that every honorable member takes a sympathetic view of it. The Government may say that the responsibility rests with the States; but I contend that this Parliament cannot escape its obligations to the unemployed. v 

##### Mr NAIRN:<br><small class="text-muted">Perth</small>

.- Wholesale merchants are put to a great deal of trouble and expense in preparing their returns, and in doing other things that are required of them under the Sales Tax Acts. To a large extent the wholesalers act as collectors of sales tax for. the Government, and the proportion of the tax collected by them is substantial, amounting in the case of some wholesale houses to thousands of pounds a year. In New Zealand the wholesalers received a discount of 5 per cent, upon the total amount of sales tax paid by them. Details of the extra amount of work which the Sales Tax Acts have thrown upon the wholesale merchants have been supplied to the Assistant Treasurer  **(Mr. Casey).**  I do not expect the Acting Leader of the House  **(Mr. Parkhill)**  to furnish me with a reply to-day, but I urge him to ask Cabinet to consider whether some compensation can be paid to these merchants. 

In many parts of the back country of Western Australia no schools are provided, but education is given by means of private correspondence. State school teachers have taken this work up enthusiastically, and a considerable amount of correspondence passes between them and children residing in outlying districts. At one time this correspondence was post free, but now the concession is confined to the set papers and the teachers' comments upon the pupils' work. The request is that the teachers should be allowed free postage on personal letters to the scholars. Personal letters are of great value, because they often afford help and encouragement to the pupils. It is claimed that, if a concession is given, it should be complete. I urge the PostmasterGeneral  **(Mr. Parkhill)**  to give favorable consideration to this request. 

##### Mr R GREEN:<br><small class="text-muted">RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; CP</small>

--  I recently brought under the notice of the Postmaster.General  **(Mr. Parkhill)**  the need for rebuilding the post office at Bangalow, and the Minister informed me that he proposed to make arrangements for the  Deputy  Director of Posts and Telegraphs to report on the matter. Has  **Mr. Kitto**  yet visited Bangalow; if not, when is he likely to do so ? The residents desire that a decision be made without delay. 

##### Mr RILEY:<br><small class="text-muted">South Sydney</small>

.- I associate myself with the remarks of the honorable member for West Sydney  **(Mr. .Beasley),**  and urge the PostmasterGeneral  **(Mr. Parkhill)**  to see whether action can be taken at the current meeting of the Loan Council to afford extra relief for the unemployed between now and Christmas. Any additional employment that may be given will amount to only a few crumbs, and something far short of what was promised by the Government at the last election. Nearly two years in the life of this Parliament have passed, and very little of a substantial character has been done by the present Government to provide work. It is most disappointing to find that large bodies of unemployed have the same sad story to tell week after week, and no hope of their deplorable position being improved. I suggest that, in order to expedite the provision of employment, the general budget debate should be postponed until after the consideration of the detailed Estimates. 

##### Mr MAKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Hindmarsh</small>

.- I cordially support the remarks of the honorable members for West Sydney  **(Mr. Beasley)**  and Cook  **(Mr. Riley).**  All honorable members, irrespective of party, desire that something shall be done to provide relief for the unemployed before Christmas, and I ask that the Commonwealth Government will supplement the assistance which the States mil render to them. 

A soldier pensioner who is dissatisfied with the assessment of his pension, or with a decision regarding his eligibility for a pension, has the right to appear before the Entitlement Tribunal to present his case, but a similar right is not accorded to the dependants of deceased returned soldiers. In their case the final court of appeal is the Repatriation Commission. This practice operates harshly in many instances. A case came before me recently in which the pension of the widow of a' deceased soldier was cancelled, because it was alleged that her mode of living made her ineligible. I was able to produce evidence of her good character from a clergyman and others associated with the mission conducted by him, as well as from a local storekeeper, a justice of the peace, and  even from the police themselves. These persons described as " vile suggestions " the allegations concerning the woman, yet she has been deprived of her pension and has no means of securing redress. So desperate is her position that she is now in receipt of destitute ration relief. Living with her is a son in his 'teens, whose presence in the home surely disproves the accusations levelled against his mother. The department has treated this woman most harshly, and she should have the right to state her case before some independent tribunal. Obviously, I cannot, from my place in this House, give details of this case, but there should be some independent body to hear and determine her appeal against the decision of the department. I ask the Minister to give this woman an opportunity to appear before the Entitlement Tribunal. 

##### Mr GANDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

-- A few evenings ago  **Mr. Edwin**  Lang Kelly, a returned soldier employed by the Commonwealth in the Census Department, was killed in a motor car accident in Canberra. Before coming here, lie resided at Belmore, in the Reid electorate.  His  death has left his wife and family in a most precarious financial position, and I ask the Acting Leader of the House to make some grant to 'his widow to enable her to meet her husband's funeral expenses and other incidental outgoings. I do not know whether or not  **Mr. Kelly**  was insured under the Workmen's Compensation Act, hut I urge that some immediate assistance be given to his widow. 

##### Mr MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Parkes &middot; UAP</small>

-- The honorable member for Hindmash  **(Mr. Makin)**  was not correct when he said that the' dependants of deceased returned soldiers could not appear before the Entitlement Tribunal. The widows of returned soldiers' may appeal to the Entitlement Tribunal. In the case of a soldier whose death, in the opinion of the Repatriation Commission, was not due to his war service, his widow has the right to approach the Entitlement Tribunal and to endeavour to prove that the man's death was, at least, in part due to his war service. Tho honorable member for Hindmarsh mentioned the case of a woman who had lost her pension because of her mode of living. Such cases are dealt with under section 37 of the act, and are always difficult. I am sure that no Minister, or officer of the department, desires to cancel the pension of a widow unless the case against . her has been proved beyond doubt. 

##### Mr Makin:

-- I know of one officer who is only too willing to cancel pensions. 

##### Mr MARR:

-- The honorable member perused the file dealing with the case he has mentioned, and had no further comment to make. 

##### Mr Makin:

-- I said that I was not satisfied. 

##### Mr MARR:

-- Instructions have been issued that no further pensions are to be cancelled under section 37 until after the pensioner has been notified of the action proposed to be taken by the department. Another member of the party to which the honorable member for Hindmarsh belongs brought a similar case under my notice, but after a thorough investigation, it was proved beyond doubt that the charge was fully justified. 

##### Mr Makin:

-- Will the Minister give this person the right to appear before the Entitlement Tribunal? 

##### Mr MARR:

-- I have not that power under the act. Parliament has provided that persons who claim to be entitled to pensions shall have the right to approach the Entitlement Tribunal, and if their claim- is granted, to appear before the Assessment Tribunal. The act must be amended before I could do what the honorable member suggests. 

##### Mr Makin:

-- Will the Government consider the necessity of amending the act in that respect? 

##### Mr MARR:

-- At present Cabinet is considering similar requests made by organizations representing returned soldiers, and I am hoping that before Parliament adjourns for the Christmas vacation some decision will be reached. 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; Balaclava &middot; UAP</small>

.- Tho honorable member for Maribyrnong  **(Mr. Fenton)**  quoted from a letter from  **Sir Clifford**  Love, in an endeavour to justify  the action he took when the Senate's request on the item covering maize products, which includes cornflour, was under consideration. Yesterday, without mentioning any name, I said that a correspondent had complained because I had presumed that his firm was working under an arrangement with Brown and Poison in Australia. LaterI corrected that by pointing out that he had purchased the Australian rights and interests of the name Brown and Poison. I regret that copies of a communication sent to me have been circulated to honorable members. Honorable members will agree that a Minister for Trade and Customs is always open to criticism by vested interests or by the representatives of an industry which may be affected by changes of customs duties. The department extends every courtesy, and provides every opportunity for representations to be made on behalf of any industry, however small,but I deprecate any attempt to exert pressure upon the Minister or private members. I am accused by  **Sir Clifford**  Love of making an attack upon the maize products industry. Nothing of the sort occurred. A Minister for Trade and Customs depends largely upon the advice tendered to him by the Tariff Board which hears evidence and makes its recommendations accordingly. While I am controlling the department, I shall not be influenced by any person or persons, but will deal with each case on its merits. I say, most emphatically, that whatever criticism may be levelled at me in communications sent direct to me or in anonymous letters to the press. I shall not deviate in the least, but shall adhere to the Government's policy, and do what I consider right in every case. 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">North Sydney</small>

. -I rise to correct an impression which must inevitably have been created by the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs  **(Mr. White)**  that  **Sir Clifford**  Love circulated among honorable members copies of the letter to which he referred. 

##### Mr White:

-- He sent a copyto the honorable member for Maribyrnong with another communication. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I know  **Sir Clifford.**  Love well. I took part in the discussion on the subject of cornflour, and I hope that I did so in an entirely proper manner.  **Sir Clifford**  did not send me a copy of the letter, and I know nothing of its contents. To that extent the statement of the Minister is incorrect. If copies of the communication were circulated amongst members, I did not receive a copy. 

##### Mr White:

-- At least one honorable member did. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- I am merely correcting the statement of the Minister because it is calculated to reflect upon the character of  **Sir Clifford**  Love. 

##### Mr White:

-- Not at all. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- Yes it is. That gentleman has as much right as any one else to bring his case before Parliament, and I do not think that it would have been improper had a copy of the communication been sent to every honorable member. The only information I received came from the Chamber of Manufactures. 

##### Mr Fenton:

-- I desire to make a personal explanation. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr.White) referred to a. portion of  **Sir Clifford**  Love's letter to him which I did not quote. 

##### Mr White:

-- I did not hear it all. 

##### Mr Fenton:

-- The only portion I quoted was that dealing with the retail price of cornflour. 1 quoted a paragraph from another letter giving the wages paid in the industry. The points mentioned by the Minister were not quoted byme. It is not unusual for those interested in customs duties to communicate with honorable members. I have received many such letters, and the communication to which I referred supports what I said about the low prices charged in Australia for cornflour. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

.- I direct the attention of the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Marr)**  to the fact that the repatriation department in Perth reduced an ex-soldier's pension without a proper official examination. Subsequently the pensioner approached the department, which recommended that an additional pension be granted. Payment at the higher amount should be made retrospective to the date on which the pension was reduced. Anonymous letters have been sent to the department which have reflected upon this man's character, and which he claims have influenced the department. I communicated with the Minister on the matter some time ago, but up to the present have not received a reply. Anonymous letters should be immediately removed from tho files and the Minister should make an authoritative statement to that effect. I ask him to look into this matter to ascertain whether some further compensation cannot be given to the person concerned. 

##### Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL:<br><small class="text-muted">Postmaster-General &middot; Warringah &middot; UAP</small>

-- I assure the honorable member for Swan  **(Mr. Gregory)**  that the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Marr)**  will, if he has not already done so, give full consideration to his representations and communicate with him on the subject. 

Every member of this House, irrespective of the party to which he belongs, is keenly and deeply interested in the provision of additional work for our people, and I shall, without delay, convey to the Prime Minister, who is at present with the Loan Council, the various requests of honorable members. 

I join with the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Scullin)**  in expressing pleasure that the Broadcasting Commission has apparently - judging by the newspaper reports - adopted the suggestion made by a deputation consisting of the Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Darling  **(Mr. Blakeley),**  the honorable member for Melbourne Ports  **(Mr. Holloway),**  and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Forde),**  that instead of engaging a military band from the United Kingdom, such an organization should be formed in Australia. There is, of course, much unemployment among musicians in the Commonwealth, and knowing their efficiency, I am sure that the commission will give serious consideration to the possibility of utilizing their talents in the way suggested. 

The honorable member for Adelaide  **(Mr. Stacey)**  proposed that work should be found for the unemployed in Adelaide by renovating the general post office. The Estimates provide for work of that nature, and the honorable member can rest assured that this means of engaging the unemployed on work of a reproductive character has not been lost sight of. 

I remind the honorable member for Perth  **(Mr. Nairn)**  that the administration of the sales tax is under constant review. I understand that various interests and organizations are bringing under the notice of the Commissioner of Taxation most of the matters which he has raised this afternoon. In any case, I shall bring them to the attention of the Treasurer. 

The other matter which the honorable member raised, with respect to which there has been a great deal of correspondence, relates to the assistance which the post office is asked to render to the education authorities of Western Australia in respect of correspondence schools. Every State in the Commonwealth carries on education by correspondence, particularly to the country and outback districts, and the Postal Department has gone so far as to permit set papers and corrections thereof, which ordinarily would come under the heading of commercial papers, to pass between teachers and pupils free of charge. That concession is accepted by all the States as a reasonable contribution to their education system. But one particular section in Western Australia has constantly urged that the Postal Department should also frank personal letters from the teacher to the pupil. That request is scarcely reasonable, and could with more justice be directed to the 'State education authorities who should pay for the service. This concession, if given to one State, would have to be given to the others and, consequently, become a matter of major importance. 

The honorable member for Richmond  **(Mr. R. Green)**  has referred to the Bangalow post office, and I admit that he has a case for consideration. The building was destroyed by fire, and the local people are, quite justifiably, agitating for the replacement of the building, so as to obviate an unsightly interval in the main street. I informed the honorable member that I would arrange for the  Deputy  Director of Postal Services in Sydney to visit Bangalow to inquire into this matter, but that officer took his leave some three weeks ago, and will not return for about ten days. While I am in Sydney this week-end I shall ascertain the exact date - which will be reasonably early - when an inquiry can be made by  **Mr. Kitto.** 

The honorable member for Reid  **(Mr. Gander)**  has referred to the tragic death of  **Mr. Edwin**  Lang Kelly, which took  place a few days ago.  **Mr. Kelly**  was employed in a temporary capacity on the Census staff, and, I understand, that under the Public Service Regulations, there can be no claim for specialcompensation. However I shall have further inquiries made and the House can rest assured that the matter will be sympathetically dealt with. Everybody naturally sympathizes with the widow and children in their bereavement. It is tragic that the breadwinner of the family, after having at last obtained temporary employment, should now be taken away. I shall bring this matter before the Treasurer to ascertain whether some compassionate allowance can be made. 

The honorable member for Cook  **(Mr. Riley)**  has suggested that the detailed Estimates might be discussed before the general debate on the budget is continued, but I do not think that, by that procedure, we would save much time. I shall, however, look into the proposal. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

House adjourned at 3.35 p.m.
