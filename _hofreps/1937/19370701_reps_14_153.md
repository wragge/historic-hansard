### INTERNATIONAL SITUATION

Wax  *in*  Spain : Non-Intervention 

AGREEMENT. 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; Kooyong &middot; UAP</small>

. -by  *leave*  - The withdrawal of the German and Italian naval units from the naval patrol of the Spanish coasts has led to the necessity for a discussion of the situation thereby created by the four powers concerned in the naval patrol - Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy - and by the chairman's sub-committee of the Non-Intervention Committee. This body, which consists of the representatives of eight powers, was set up on the 14th September last to cooperate with the  chairman  of the Nonintervention Committee in the practical application of the non-intervention agreement. According to information received by the Commonwealth Government, the chairman's sub-committee will meet on Friday, the 2nd July, to consider the proposals of the four Powers hitherto responsible for the naval patrol of the Spanish coasts in regard to the future operation of the patrol. Nothing in the nature of an ultimatum has been delivered to the German and Italian Governments by the British and French Governments. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">WEST SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the Government received any information regarding the international situation which would warrant a statement such as that made by the Acting Prime Minister of New Zealand, who is reported to have said at a convention in Auckland yesterday that " since 1914 we have never been closer to a world war than last Thursday"? 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- This Government has received no information which would, in my opinion, warrant so grave a statement as that.-

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-2-0}
#### SCRAP IRON AND TIN

Restriction of Export

##### Mr JOHN LAWSON:<br><small class="text-muted">MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-- In view of the ominous position that has developed in Europe, and in view of the contention occurring in the East, will the Government give further consideration to the question of curtailing the export from Australia of scrap iron and scrap tin. either by the imposition of an export duty or by imposing an embargo? 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; Balaclava &middot; UAP</small>

--  *by leave*  - The request for an embargo on exports of scrap steel is not a new proposal, and fears have been expressed on several occasions during the past ten or twelve years that shortage of supplies would prevent local users from carrying on. Subsequent events have proved, however, that these fears were unfounded. The request for an embargo was again made a few months ago, and the matter has since' been under close observation. The following export" figures of scrap iron and steel for recent years show that this is not a new export: -  


<graphic href="153331193707016_1_0.jpg"></graphic>


Overseas countries and Australian industries have a greater demand for metals, with a consequent increase of prices, and scrap metal prices also have, naturally, advanced. This position has been affected by Japanese competition, and the fact that recently the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited came on the market to buy scrap. 

The price of scrap steel in the United Stales of America rose from £3 13s. 2d. in January, 1937, to £4 4s. Sd. in April, and fell again to £3 19s. lOd. in May. In tho United Kingdom the prices ranged from £2 17s. Cd. in January, to £3 10s. in April, 1937. The prices vary in Australia, the latest information being - 


<graphic href="153331193707016_1_1.jpg"></graphic>


According to the figures, therefore, local manufacturers have been obtaining their supplies of scrap steel at figures below those ruling in overseas countries. 

A deputation on this matter waited on rae in May last. The employers' side was put by  **Mr. Timmins,**  the representative of Melbourne Iron and Steel Mills Pro.rietary Limited, which company has been taking a most prominent part in the agitation for an embargo.  **Mr. Timmins**  had represented in 1934 that his company could not pay more than 25s. a ton for scrap steel and make a profit on the finished article, but he admitted at the interview that he had no difficulty in selling all the steel that he could manufacture. It was admitted by this company's representative at the recent deputation that there was no real shortage of supplies. That is the principal consideration which affects the Government. If unemployment were likely to be caused, or if Australian industry might be greatly hindered, some action would have been taken; but the 'principal company interested, as the honorable member for Melbourne Ports  **(Mr. .Holloway),**  who introduced the deputation, admitted, said that the question was one of price. 

##### Mr Holloway:

-- The prices are uneconomic. 

##### Mr WHITE:

-- But manufacturers pass on increased costs. It was further admitted that the difficulty would probably be of a temporary nature only, and that the demand for scrap would be considerably eased, probably towards the end of - the year, \vhen the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited's new blast ' furnace for treating pig iron had been completed. 

The Melbourne  *Herald*  of the 29th May last, reported that the Japanese were going off the scrap market until prices return to normal, and that the announcement had resulted in a substantial reduction of the price. The department has been receiving frequent and regular reports on this aspect, and recent advices indicate that there has been an appreciable weakening of prices. The latest report from Victoria states that the price lias dropped by 15s. a ton ; that very little new business is being done with Japanese buyers, and that the scrap steel being exported is chiefly in fulfilment of past contracts. Latest reports from other States also show that .the position has eased, and users are not being handicapped by shortage of supplies. At one time the price of scrap steel was so lowthat, owing to freight and other considerations, it was not worth while to collect it and bring it any distance. The recent increase of price has encouraged certain firms and individuals to engage in the collection from all parts of the country of this material, which would otherwise be wasted. The Government is not prepared to interfere with trade and force down prices by imposing an export embargo, unless there is very good reason for this course. Upon a careful review of all the facts, it is not considered that the present position is such  as to justify an embargo on export of scrap steel. The situation is being closely watched, and, if there is any change to justify action, the Government will take it. 

A Melbourne firm recently made representations to the Trade and Customs Department for assistance in establishing a new industry for recovering tin and steel from scrap metals. This firm asked for an embargo or. an export duty on scrap cast iron and scrap tin to an extent that the prices of these materials to local purchasers would be reduced to £2 a ton for scrap cast iron, and £1 10s. a ton for scrap tin. It was estimated that, if the request were approved, the new industry would give employment in Victoria to 27 men, involving wages amounting to £6,500 per annum.  Some  time ago the department made inquiries, and ascertained that there was practically no overseas demand for scrap .cast iron, and, that even without such competition, the material  waa being sold  locally for from £4 to £4 5s. a ton. In recent' months, the Japanese have taken some of our scrap cast iron, but it seems obvious that neither an export duty nor an export prohibition would make scrap cast iron available to local users at a price approximating £2 a ton. Taking the price of £7 a ton for scrap tin, an export duty of £5 10s. a ton would be necessary to make the material available  to local  users at £1 10s. The export of scrap tin from Victoria alone for 1936-37 would exceed 3,000 tons, and, on the basis of a reduction of price by £5 10s. a ton, the loss to Victorian canister makers  alone would  be about £17,000, which is nearly three times the estimated wages to be paid to those to be engaged in the new industry in Victoria. It is contrary to Government policy to interfere with trade by imposing export restrictions, unless there is very good reason for  such action. In  the case of this industry the proposition does not appear to be an economic one, and it seems that the industry could exist only if it were afforded assistance altogether out of proportion to its value. After careful consideration,  the request  for an embargo on scrap tin and scrap cast iron could not be approved.

#### FINANCIAL STATEMENT

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">CAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Is the Acting Treasurer in a position to make a brief statement regarding the financial transactions of the Government for the year ended the 30th June? 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- I regret to say that I am not. The accounts closed only last night, and it will take two or three days for the results to be made available in accurate form. As soon as they are available, I shall make a public statement about them.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-4-0}
#### WHEAT FREIGHTS

##### Mr PROWSE:<br><small class="text-muted">FORREST, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Is the Minister for Commerce aware of the enormous increase of wheat freights from Australia to the United Kingdom and the Continent of Europe made by the shipping companies? If so, is the Government able to do anything to prevent these excessive charges? Is wheat included in the freights controlled by the Australian Overseas Transport Association? 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Commerce &middot; COWPER, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; CP</small>

-- The answer to the first question is " Yes ", and the reply to each of the two subsequent questions is " No ". In view of the fact that a number of inquiries have been made as to the method o*f charging for the carriage of wheat and the reason for the increase of the rates, I had intended to make a short statement as to the manner in which it is done. 


 *By leave -* 


Most of the wheat shipped from Australia is transported on vessels specially chartered for the purpose. It is customary for wheat shippers to arrange their own charter in London. This is done through their own London offices, where such exist, and otherwise through shipping agents in this country. A Tramp Shipping Administrative Committee is established in London, and it . determines a scheme of minimum freight' rates for the Australian grain trade homeward, and to Eastern ports. These rates appear to be 'the basic bargaining point upon which actual charges are arranged. Whether these minimum rates shall be charged with respect to a particular charter, or some premium above them be also applied, depends in  the  first analysis upon the amount of shipping available to meet applications for charters, or anticipated charters, at any particular time. In other words, charter rates are, to a great extent, dependent upon the demand for freights, and upon the available supply for not only the Australian grain trade but also the trade throughout the world. A heavy demand for freights from Argentina or Canada would undoubtedly affect the rates to be applied to Australian shipments. 

Only a small proportion of the wheat from Australia is shipped on other than chartered vessels. This small percentage is carried as parcels, and the parcel rates arc determined by the Overseas Shipping Representatives Association. The Australian Overseas Transport Association makes arrangements with respect to freights on certain commodities exported from Australia, but wheat shipments do not come within its jurisdiction. As already explained, wheat freights are determined by arrangement between shippers and shipping companies, and the matter of the rates operating in regard to them is one which is beyond the scope of the Government's control.

#### AIR MAIL SERVICES

Position of "Western Australia. 

##### Mr A GREEN:<br><small class="text-muted">KALGOORLIE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936</small>

-- I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General if he has noticed a paragraph published in the  *West Australian*  of the 25th June, in which a telegraphic message from Melbourne stated, "It is considered certain that federal Ministers and officials will discuss soon the prospects of the Empire air-mail service being diverted from Darwin to Adelaide to serveWestern Australia, South Australia, and possibly Victoria and Tasmania " ? Is he aware that this report has greatly alarmed the people ofWestern Australia, more particularly those living in the northwest of the State?When this matter is being considered, will he take into account the risks involved in reducing the efficiency of the service up the north-west coast, if the service is diverted to Adelaide; also that the proposal would entail a slower service from the Old Country? There is a good deal of indignation in "Western Australia in regard to this proposal, and I trust that the service to that State will not be curtailed for the benefit of log-rollers in the eastern States. 


 **Mr. SPEAKER (Hon. G. J. Bell).Order** ! 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- The representations made by the honorable member in respect of this matter will be fully considered. 

##### Mr NAIRN:<br><small class="text-muted">PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- In connexion with the proposed tri-weekly air-mail service between Darwin and London, I ask the Acting Prime Minister if the Government will consider the completion of the existing north-west service between Perth and Wyndham by extending it to Darwin and connecting it with the overseas service, instead of carrying the mails by a roundabout route through Adelaide or Sydney ? 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

-- The honorable member's representations' will be considered.

### BRITISH SHIPPING PROTECTION BILL

##### Mr HAWKER:<br><small class="text-muted">WAKEFIELD, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I ask the Acting Prime Minister why the bill which was introduced last session to provide protection for British shipping between New Zealand and Australia against foreign competition does not appear on the noticepaper this session? Is it because this objective has been dropped, or because of pressure of business, or is it due to the fact that further negotiations are being carried on with New Zealand or some other Empire countries? 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

-- The position in respect of that measure is that it has been restored to the notice-paper in the Senate, where it has been brought exactly to the same stage as it had reached last session, preparatory to further action being taken.

#### SHORTER WORKING WEEK

##### Mr DRAKEFORD:<br><small class="text-muted">MARIBYRNONG, VICTORIA</small>

-- Is the Attorney- 

General aware that the Public Service Arbitrator, in giving judgment to-day on the claims of the Public Service for a 40-hour week, stated that, whilst as an individual he held the view that a 40- hour week was warranted, he thought that, as a national question, its initiation rightly concerned Parliament? Will the Government, in view of that statement by the Public Service Arbitrator, give early consideration to the matter of taking  action  to bring into operation the 40- hour week for industry, and to give it immediate application to those employed in the service of the Commonwealth Government ? 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- I have heard of the general nature of the determination of the Public Service Arbitrator, but I haw not had an opportunity to see any of the remarks he made; these, of course, will receive full consideration.

#### PHYSICAL TRAINING OF YOUTHS

##### Sir Donald CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">LILLEY, QUEENSLAND &middot; UAP</small>

-- With reference to the reply given , bv the Minister for Defence to the question asked by the honorable member for Lilley on the 3rd December, 1936, regarding the physical training of the youth of the Commonwealth, have any definite requests been received from the States for Commonwealth co-operation or assistance in this respect? Has the Acting Minister any further information on the subject of the physical training of the youth of the Commonwealth ? 

##### Mr THORBY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister without portfolio assisting the Minister for Commerce &middot; CALARE, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; CP</small>

-- Prior to his departure for England, the Minister for Defence brought under my notice certain discussions which had taken place between himself and the education authorities in some of the States, and expressed anxiety that the whole of the States should be consulted with a view to establishing physical training facilities in each State for the youth of Australia. Those arrangements have not yet been, completed.

-- I am unaware that the Tasmanian Government refused lo do as the honorable member says. I understand that that Government was to consider the matter at a cabinet meeting and I have not yet received any word concerning the outcome of that meeting. 

##### Mr MAHONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">DENISON, TASMANIA</small>

-- In view of the incorrect statement published in the  *Sydney Morning Herald*  regarding the attitude of Tasmania to the proposed Unemployment Insurance Conference, will the Acting Prime Minister in future refuse all information to that paper unless it guarantees to publish correct reports? 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:

-- It is very easy to omit a few essential words when a report is being abbreviated. I did "not give the representative of the newspaper a typed statement; I merely answered verbally a question as to the number of State governments that had replied and said that we were awaiting the .decision of the Tasmanian Government. 

##### Mr McCALL:

-- I ask the Acting Prime Minister if his attention has been drawn to the following statement appearing in to-day's  *Sydney Morning Herald -* 

  >The Acting Prime Minister announced today that all of the States, except Tasmania, had agreed to discuss the 40-hour week at the conference on national insurance which will be held in August.  **Dr. Page**  said that the conference would be held in the second or third week of the month? 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:

-- The statement which I really made to the press in respect of this matter was that all States except Tasmania had agreed to this proposal and that the reply I had received from the Tasmanian Government was that it would submit this matter to the Tasmanian Cabinet.

##### Mr THORBY:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

-- My recollection is that Queensland, Victoria, South. Australia and Western Australia have already passed legislation along those lines whilst New .South Wales has agreed to pass similar legislation but has not yet submitted a measure to Parliament. Tasmania is the only State that has not even agreed to introduce such legislation, and from various discussions which I have had with representatives of the grazing industry in Tasmania, I understand that that Government is not inclined to do so. New Zealand and South Africa have agreed to co-operate with Australia in this matter.

The Government of Western Australia has not asked the Commonwealth Government to intervene in the development of the deposits, and, from the information available it would probably resent such intervention if it were offered.

#### PRICE OF BUTTER

##### Mr HOLT:<br><small class="text-muted">FAWKNER, VICTORIA</small>

-- It has been stated by the Secretary of the Dairy Produce Equalization Committee that the latest increase of the price of butter by Id. per lb. was not to offset losses on exports, but was a straight-out benefit to farmers. Will the Acting Prime Minister state whether it is a fact that there have been two recent increases in the price of butter which will mean an additional annual cost to consumers of £1,720,000? Is it practicable to inquire into the prices charged for primary products in the same way as inquiries are made into secondary industries in order that while the producer can thus be assured of a reasonable price for his product, the consumer may be protected against any possibility of" exploitation? What steps can be taken to ensure that the consumers of butter will be safeguarded ? 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

-- There have not been two or three recent increases of the price of butter. The last previous increase, I understand, was in 1934, when the price was stabilized at 140a. per cwt. As to whether the Tariff Board should inquire into primary industries in order to determine whether exploitation is taking place under the cover of protective duties, I remind the honorable member that such duties are of little value to an industry which must export more than half of its total production. That was why the Government asked the people to approve a marketing scheme, which alone would assure to the butter producers a protected home market. The primary industries are willing to submit to examination by any impartial body, but their presentcondition is clearly indicated by the fact that the Government has had to find £12,000,000 for the adjustment of farmers' debts. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:<br><small class="text-muted">DALLEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that the Dairy Equalization Committee is not only dictating to the retailers the price at which they must sell butter, but that they have also notified them that if they give any consideration by way of coupons, bonuses, &amp;c, their supplies of butter will be cut off? In view of this attempt to force up the price of butter, and to control other people's business- 

##### Mr SPEAKER (Hon Gr J Bell:<br><small class="text-muted">DARWIN, TASMANIA</small>



The honorable member is making an accusation, and not asking a question. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- What action does the Government propose to take? 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:

-- I think that the action of the butter producers is on a par with that of labour leaders who demand preference to unionists in regard to what they have to sell. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">MORETON, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Is the Minister for Commerce aware that many dairy farmers, owing to drought conditions, have had their production for the season cut by more than 40 per cent.; that a great many of them have been receiving returns less than the basic wage, ana are, in fact, in necessitous circumstances? 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:

-- -A very large part of the coastal districts of Queensland and New South Wales, which usually supply more than half the butter produced in the Commonwealth, has experienced exceptionally dry conditions, so that the State governments have had to take steps to provide farmers with fodder for their stock. Butter production during the last four or five months has been reduced to a minimum. 

##### Mr GANDER:<br><small class="text-muted">REID, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- In view of the controversy regarding the alleged exploitation of the consumers by the butter producers, will the Acting Prime Minister have inquiries made regarding the advisability of introducing into Australia the butter tree, which is described in a recent publication as follows: - 

  >Butter from a tree sounds ridiculous, but there is such a commodity. The tree from which it is obtained is the butter tree of Weft Africa. The product is Shea butter, a finer produce than the best animal butter. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member's question is facetious, and cannot be answered. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that, in my previous question, I made no reference to trade unions or trade-union awards? Will he state what action the Government proposes to take against the Dairy Equalization Committee, which not only forces retailers to increase the price of butter, but also dictates terms to the effect that they must not give concessions in the shape of coupons- 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! I have already warned the honorable member that he must not make accusations under the guise of asking questions, and he has disregarded my ruling. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- I give it up; you do not want to hear me. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member for Dalley is out of order. He must withdraw that statement. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- What did I say? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member was offensive to the Chair in his attitude and gesticulations, as well as in his words. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- I cannot withdraw a gesticulation. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member will immediately apologize to the Chair. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- What for? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- For his offensive attitude and remarks. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- I cannot withdraw a remark I did not make. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable member was distinctly offensive. The Chair was merely enforcing the rules governing the asking of questions. On two occasions the honorable member disregarded the ruling of the Chair, and when called to order deliberately defied the Chair. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- I did not defy the Chair. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Will the honorable member apologize to the Chair? 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- If I knew what T had to apologize for, I would. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I name the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear).** 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- What have I done ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The Chair has been most tolerant, as every honorable member will realize. Because the honorable member was called to order, he threw his arms about and said "I give it up; you do not want to hear ", but if he says that he intended no offence to the Chair I shall be satisfied. 

##### Mr Curtin:

-- I think that the honorable member for Dalley is under a misapprehension. I am sure that he can unreservedly give an assurance that he meant no offence to the' Chair. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I shall be satisfied with such an assurance if the honorable member for Dalley will give it. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- Of course, I will.

#### Second Reading

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; Kooyong &middot; UAP</small>

, -  I move - 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

This is a very large measure. I introduce it to-day, not in an endeavour to have it passed during the present sittings of the House, but in order that honorable members, as well as the commercial community, and others affected by it, may have a full opportunity to examine and consider it before the House next meets. The necessity for a lengthy speech by me disappears, having regard to the nature of a document that I have had prepared, which contains three things. The first is a very full report by a committee which I appointed to examine the patent law; the second, the existing patent law, and the third, the bill, printed on opposite pages, so that when considering this proposal, honorable members may have not only the benefit of a general explanation of points that have been made the subject of alteration, but also, on opposite pages, the relative portions of the existing legislation and the proposed measure. I venture to think that honorable members generally will find that an extremely convenient form for the consideration of the measure. 

In 1929, the Board of Trade in Great Britain appointed an expert committee to report as to whether any amendments of the British Patent Act were desirable. As the result of the report of the committee so set up, very extensive amendments were made in the law in Great Britain in 1932. Subsequently,- a good deal of the work done in England in 1932 received consideration in Australia, and from time to time various suggestions were made as to the incorporation of some of it in the Australian law. In those circumstances, and knowing from my own experience of patent law that several matters very urgently required attention, I invited a committee of gentlemen to undertake what I suggested to them was a real public service, namely, a thorough examination of the patent law, and the decisions that had been given upon it, a full comparison with patent laws elsewhere, the consolidation of the whole of the existing law, and the recommendation of such amendments as seemed desirable to make the law more effective, improve the expedition of transactions under it, and increase the security attaching to such transactions. The committee to which I' made that reference consisted of the Solicitor-General,  **Mr. Knowles,**  the Commissioner of Patents,  **Mr. Wallach, Mr. L.**  B. Davies, a patent attorney, of Melbourne, who at the time of the appointment was  president  of the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia, and  **Mr. Arthur**  Dean, a barrister, of Melbourne, who has had extensive experience in the patent jurisdiction, and for whose ability in relation to these matters I have a very high regard. That committee sat for a long time, and did a great deal of work, for which I express the deep gratitude of the Government. 

##### Mr Brennan:

--  It acted in an honorary capacity? 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- Yes, and did an enormous amount of work. When the report of the committee was completed, and the bill had been prepared, the result was submitted by me to  **Mr. R.**  S. Bonney, K.C., of Sydney, who is a very eminent practitioner in patent and trade marks work at the Sydney Bar. He, too, very generously made an examination of the matter, and offered further suggestions which, in turn, were considered by the committee, and in some cases were adopted and incorporated in the bill. I mention these facts in order to show that, apart from the ordinary examination which I, with a fairly considerable experience of patent law, would make, these matters have had very close and special consideration by a highly competent committee. I am hopeful that in consequence this legislation will not only bring our patent law completely up to date, but also make it a much more effective instrument for the establishment and preservation of the rights  of  industrial property in Australia. I feel that there is no doubt that on the passing of this measure, the patent law of Australia will be more up to date than that of any other country. 

The bill is one which, to the extent that it requires to be discussed at all, will no doubt be discussed in committee; consequently, I do not propose to traverse it in detail. I merely want to indicate briefly several respects in which changes ure made in the existing law. 

The first change that I need refer to is that relating to the registration of patents. At the present time, no obligation is placed on the person who becomes the owner of a patent, on transmission or by assignment, to register the fact, with the result that sometimes it is a matter of great difficulty to discover who owns the patent or to establish formal proof of ownership. Clause  21  of the bill proposes to require that where a person becomes entitled to a patent by assignment or transmission, he must apply to the commissioner to register his title; in other words, and in substantial brevity, it requires compulsory registration of the title to patents. 

##### Mr LAZZARINI:<br><small class="text-muted">WERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

--  Is any better protection being given to the inventor? 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- I believe that, on ( lie whole, the clarification of the law improves the position of the inventor. 

The next matter that I need refer to has a bearing on the point raised by the honorable member. At the present time, it occasionally happens that an invention to which a man has directed' his ingenuity, and which he has genuinely made, is invalidated ; that is to say, he is prevented from obtaining protection in relation to it, because it has become known to some other person or the public without his knowledge or consent. The bill overcomes that difficulty by providing that, in cases in which an invention is made public without the authority or knowledge of the inventor, he shall not lose his right to obtain a patent in relation to it. 

Under the existing law, certain provisions relating to the revocation of patents are somewhat obscurely phrased. It is said, for example, that a patent may be revoked on any ground on which it might have been revoked by writ of  *scire facias*  at common law. That has given rise to no end of difficulties, because the grounds on which the common law proceedings may be launched are themselves by no means beyond doubt. Therefore, in this bill an endeavour has been made to produce certainty on that point by setting out elaborately and with particularity the various grounds on which the revocation of a patent may be sought by any applicant. 

The next matter to which I wish to refer is concerned with the jurisdiction of the High Court. The High Court has no general jurisdiction to-day in actions arising out of infringement of patents. In fact, actions for infringement are usually brought in the Supreme Courts of the various States. "When an action for infringement is brought in the Supreme Court of a State, and the defendant - the alleged infringe!" - wishes to challenge the validity of the patent,  he  may counter claim for revocation. He may also, in entirely different circumstances, apply to the High Court for the revocation of the patent. In other words, there is some confusion and overlapping of jurisdiction. The bill proposes to give to the High Court general jurisdiction, concurrently with the Supreme Courts, in infringement actions. It also provides that where a defendant in an action for infringement in a Supreme Court counter claims for revocation of the patent, the action will automatically be referred into the High Court; in other words, the revocation of patents will be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court. The result will be to eliminate certain proceedings that occur to-day. A further advantage will be uniformity of decision, and greater certainty in the law. 

Another matter to which I might refer is that an appeal tribunal in patent matters is to be established. That tribunal will be the High Court, constituted by a single justice thereof. The object is to provide, as far as possible, that patent matters shall be heard by a judge who is conversant  Avith  patent law- which, as honorable members will realize, is a department of the law in which there is a tendency to specialize, and with respect to which a great deal of special knowledge is required. Under the existing law, certain appeals in patent matters may be brought to the law officer, who is the Attorney-General, or, in certain cases the Crown Solicitor. It is proposed to abolish the appeal to the' law officer, as well as to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, and to concentrate in the High Court the appeal in those cases, the High Court being made the special appeal tribunal, constituted according to the description that I have given. 

The last matter to which I wish to refer is small, but not unimportant; it is, that the bill makes certain alterations of the law relating to the registration of patent attorneys. At the present time there is no  requirement in the law that a patent attorney need be a British subject or 21 years of age. The result is that there is no restriction on the registration of aliens, nor is there any age limit. It is proposed to provide that an applicant for registration must satisfy theCommissioner of Patents that he is a British subject and not less than 21 years of age. There are other provisions of a highly necessary kind, to prevent unqualified persons from practising. 

These are just a few matters that I have selected from those that are dealt with in the bill. I warmly commend to honorable members their consideration of the memorandum that I have had circulated, which, I am sure, will prove of very great value. The supply of copies of the memorandum is limited, and I am not in a position to provide more than one copy for each member. In it will be found, I believe, a complete illumination, not only by description, but also by comparison of one page with another, of the nature of the proposals made in the bill. I hope that I may be permitted to express on my own account the hope that by this means we shall be able to effect a complete overhaul of the patent law. It is not, I agree, a matter which attracts much political interest, but it is the kind of legislation which is of considerable importance to a large number of persons in the community.

### JUDICIARY BILL

{:#subdebate-23-0}
#### Second Reading

Debate resumed from the 29th June  *(vide*  page 685), on motion by  **Mr. Menzies**  - 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

.- This is really a draftsman's measure which does not change, but merely restates the law to bring within the Judiciary Act the particular provisions contained in that act and other acts relating to the rules of court. I am rather at a loss to understand why section 202  of the  Electoral Act has been omitted from the schedule. That section provides that the High Court may make rules relating to the hearing of election petitions. It  follows the old form providing for the laying of such rules onthe table  of the  House within 40 days after the making of them. As this measure is quite useful, and will make the law more accessible than at present, I commend it to the House. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time. 


 *In committee:* 


The bill. 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; Kooyong &middot; UAP</small>

-- The comment  made  moment ago by the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  is quite natural, having regard to the contents of the bill. Section 202 of the Electoral Act confers upon the Justices of the High Court the power to make rules, but as the power to make rules is not for the regular practice and procedure of the High Court, but for the Court of Disputed Returns, it has been thought that any such amendment as that contained in this bill should be made as an amendment of the Electoral Act, to bring it into line with what we are now doing. Consequently-, when the Electoral Act is next before Parliament for amendment, steps will be taken to introduce into it uniform provisions with those contained in this bill. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

.- I can understand the suggestion  that the  Electoral Act should be amended, but I cannot understand the suggestion that the jurisdiction conferred by section 202 is not conferred upon the High Court as such. Provision is made in section 184' of the act that the High Court should be a court of disputed returns, and it refers to the jurisdiction of the High Court. Under that section, the High Court exercises a special jurisdiction, but it is still the High Court. On that account it might be thought that  it  would be more convenient to make the amendment in the Electoral Act. I point out that the Patents Bill, which was before us a few minutes ago, contains a provision based upon that section.  I offer  no objection to this bill on the ground that it does not include the section of the Electoral Act to which I have referred, but I thought it right to draw attention to it. 

Bill agreed to, and reported from committee without amendment; report adopted. 

Bill -  *by leave*  - read a third time.

### MEDICAL RESEARCH ENDOWMENT BILL 1937

{:#subdebate-24-0}
#### Second Reading

Debate resumed from the 30th June,  *{vide*  page 774), on motion by  **Mr. Hughes**  - 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

##### Mr E J HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP; LP from 1944</small>

-- I commend tin's bill to honorable members. It is highly desirable that it should be passed. I would have been. glad had its provisions been more comprehensive in some respects, but, as it is, the measure evidently gives effect to strong recommendations that have been made for some time to various governments in connexion with the general health of the community. We have made available, from time to time, various sums of money for research into agricultural diseases, diseases in cattle, tick eradication, and the like, but Australia is one of the few remaining countries in which no generous sum of money has been made available for medical research work. 

The principle of this measure,  which  is sound, is  based  on the utmost simplicity, with the object of regularizing research into medical problems. Notwithstanding its simplicity, however, the bill is one of the most important submitted to the Parliament this session, for  it  deals with fundamentals, and recognizes the necessity for governmental administration. 'Good government must obviously be concerned with the health of the people. It should also give attention, through some of its activities, to the health trends of various nations, for they have been the cause of humbling many mighty peoples in the .past. History is full of experiences and evidence that will bear out this statement. The Minister for Health  **(Mr. Hughes)**  has supplied honorable members with certain figures dealing with disorders of one kind and another that are, in themselves, rather alarming, embracing tuberculosis, cancer, heart disease, and other common ailments. He pointed out that our general death rate, which is 9.4 per cent., was low - possibly the lowest in the world, excepting New Zealand. But the pleasure that the contemplation of this fact may give us is destroyed when we take into account the percentage of population contained in our youngest age groups. Quite obviously, as the years pass, these people will pass out of young age groups into- older age groups and an increased death rate must automatically follow. Honorable members have seen an indication of this in the increased number of applications for the old-age pension. 

##### Mr Curtin:

--  Does the honorable member desire this bill to be passed at this  sitting! 

##### Mr E J HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP; LP from 1944</small>

-- I do; but I wish to advance some facts which I think even the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin)**  will regard as sufficiently serious to justify the time taken in submitting them.  *[Quorum formed.]*  It is not my intention to delay the passage of- the bill, but the facts that I propose  to  advance will  be of  such a character  as  should cause the Government to consider whether the scope of the proposed research should not  be  widened in certain respects. I shall  refer,  first, to certain considerations which  are  largely responsible  fm  our infantile death rate, which is higher  to-day than it was 30 years ago.We should also be seriously concerned by the fact that our maternal mortality rate is higher than it was 25 years ago. I havebefore me a number of reports on this subject to which I desired to direct attention, but I shall not occupy time in doing so at the moment. Various committees which have investigated this subnet over a period of years, both in Australia and overseas, have drawn attention to the fact that toxaemias of various kinds have never been traced directly to their cause. This important fact should be investigated. The final report of the Departmental Committee on Maternal Mortality and Morbidity, issued by the Ministry for Health in London, makes the following significant statement on this point: - 

  >Owing to too infrequent examinations of urine and the assumption of blood pressure, toxaemias are often not recognized in time and even when recognized they are often inadequately treated. The causation of these toxaemias is not understood, and very little advance has been made towards new knowledge. 

I ask that the Medical Research Institute be requested to make an investigation into this subject, and also into the cause and eradication of puerperal sepsis, which is astoundingly prevalent. A comprehensive report on these subjects, arising from investigations by research officers, would be invaluable. 

Various persons of high standing who have investigated the important subject of maternal mortality have made reports upon it to the Government from time to time. I refer, in particular, to Dame Janet Campbell, who visited Australia some time ago, and also  **Dr. Sydney**  Morris. Every effort should be made to overcome this wastage of our national life. The recommendations made in connexion with child-birth also deserve serious consideration. I urge the Minister to direct the Medical Research Institute to inquire into the extraordinary wastage of life that occurs in this direction. Of the 500 mothers who die in Australia in each year, one-half of them are about 30 years of age, and about onethird die in their first experience of motherhood. These are the women who should be likely to bear the greatest number of children.  *[Quorum formed."]*  I am sorry to notice that the Opposition as a whole is so callous with regard to this measure, and that its obstructionist tactics prevent me from completing my remarks.

##### Mr James:

-- The honorable member for Wentworth said that the Opposition as a whole was callous and then, after he had resumed his seat and the honorable member for Denison  **(Mr. Mahoney)**  had taken a point of order, he again rose and said that those remarks particularly referred to the honorable member for Hunter. That is personally offensive to mo and I ask that it be withdrawn.

##### Mr Forde:

-- That is just as unfair. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Fremantle</small>

.- Far from being disinterested the Opposition welcomes this bill, is even eager to expedite its passage and was of the impression that sufficient had been said last night to make the bill intelligible to the Parliament and the country, and to render it unnecessary for anything further to be said. I made the distinct offer to the Minister for Health  **(Mr. Hughes)**  that he could have a bill to-day without further debate. 

##### Mr E J HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP; LP from 1944</small>

-- Why should the Leader of the Opposition determine what I am to do? 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- But if electioneering speeches were to be delivered by Government supporters then most certainly further speeches would be made on our side. I answer the charge of disinterestedness by directing attention to a report on child endowment which, in 1928 in association with  **Mrs. Mildred**  Muscio, I wrote in my capacity as a Commissioner, in which, representations that work of the character which this .bill makes possible should be carried out were made to the Commonwealth Government. I rose only to impress these facts on the honorable member for "Wentworth  **(Mr. E. J. Harrison)**  in order that I might make it plain that the Opposition congratulates the Government on. bringing down this measure. It regards it as a definite contribution towards enabling important national problems to be scientifically and properly dealt with. "We hope that provision will be practicable, in future budgets, no matter what government introduces them, to ensure sufficient money for this research work to be comprehensively and adequately done.

#### Second Reading


 **Mr. MENZIES** (Kooyong- Acting 

Treasurer) [4.5.]. - I move - 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

These Supplementary Estimates for the year 1935-36 are comprised of items of expenditure for that year for which no specific approval has yet been given by Parliament; they were met temporarily out of the provision for Treasurer's advance, pending submission to Parliament. Authority for this expenditure was included in the advance to the Treasurer, amounting to £2,000,000, in the Estimates in general for that year. That provision enabled the Treasurer to make advances to meet necessary expenditure not contemplated when the Estimates in chief were presented. Details are set out in the document circulated among honorable members. Of the £2,000,000 voted to the Treasurer, £870,281 was advanced, £679,450 of which was for ordinary departmental services and war services payable from revenue, and £190,831 for additions, new works and buildings. 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- Some of the amount represents expenditure in connexion with royal commissions. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Fremantle</small>

.- The Opposition knows that this is a customary practice. The obligation on the Government to submit these Supplementary Estimates to Parliament preserves the authority of Parliament over public expenditure. In respect of expenditure of this description, that authority is more nominal than actual, but that is unavoidable. The only suggestion that can be made is one with which I feel certain the Acting Treasurer  **(Mr. Menzies)**  will agree, namely, that Supplementary Estimates ought to be presented to Parliament at the earliest possible moment. Further, in making so substantial an advance to the Treasurer as is customary under the general Estimates, there ought to be some understanding that departures from policy not envisaged in the budget should be made the subject of a definite intimation to 'the Parliament before expenditure is incurred in connexion therewith. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.

#### Second Reading


 **Mr. MENZIES** (Kooyong- Acting 

Treasurer) [4.8]. - I move - 

  >That the bill be now read a  second time. 

This bill covers the new works aspect of the Supplementary Estimates. The only tiling that I need say in connexion with it is that of the £190,831, the main  item is £165,000 for telephone services, including -the telephone cable, between the mainland and Tasmania. These works are of a reproductive nature. 

##### Mr MAHONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Denison</small>

.- Is it the intention of the PostmasterGeneral's Department to devote some of the profits derived from radio licences to the carrying out of the building programme of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Melbourne, Sydney, and Hobart? From time to time the Government has promised to erect a studio in Hobart for the commission so that the services . of the local artists could be availed of. At present, so far as national stations are concerned, the people of Tasmania have to rely on programmes from the mainland States. That is contrary to the policy of decentralization advocated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I am disappointed that this bill does not provide funds for the building of a studio at Hobart, as promised. About eighteen months ago the  chairman  of the commission said that plans and specifications would immediately be drawn up to enable the building to be proceeded with. Later we were told that  **Mr. Cleary**  was to go abroad to inquire into new methods and improved technique, with a view to improving the broadcasting services- in this country. He has now returned to Australia, and there is no longer any excuse for delay. Two blocks of land in Hobart have been purchased by the commission, and the old building on one of them has been demolished. The house on the other block is unoccupied. Such poor business management is not to the credit of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Eighteen months ago I was informed that the -first studio to be erected for the commission would be at Hobart, but I now understand that the commission has decided that new buildings must first be provided for Sydney and Melbourne, and has stated  that there  is not sufficient money to build a studio at Hobart. I hold the Government to its promise to erect the first building at Hobart.  **Mr. Cleary, chairman**  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, has thrown the responsibility on- the Government, which, he says, has not made sufficient money available to the commission to erect these buildings. The delay in this matter is causing the people of Tasmania to lose faith in the present G-overnment; their attitude to it will be reflected at the next election. The Government cannot evade its responsibilities by saying that the people of Tasmania have not pressed for the erection of a studio at Hobart, for I, as well as other honorable members, have brought this matter forward on many occasions. I also protest against the extravagance of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in buying two blocks of land when one would have sufficed. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-I shall convey the honorable member's protest to the PostmasterGeneral. 

##### Mr BARNARD:<br><small class="text-muted">Bass</small>

.- I support the remarks of the honorable member for Denison  **(Mr. Mahoney)**  concerning the unsatisfactory wireless broadcasting service provided in Tasmania. The Acting Treasurer  **(Mr. Menzies)**  informed the House that as this measure covers only the Supplementary Estimates for 1936, the remarks of the honorable member for Denison were somewhat irrevelant, but as debate on the Supply Bill was curtailed, we have had no other opportunity to bring the matter before the House. 


 **Mr. SPEAKER (Hon.** G. J. Bell).I  do not wish to curtail the remarks of the honorable member, but the subject he is discussing is irrelevant. 

##### Mr BARNARD:

-- I do not desire to transgress your ruling,  **Mr. Speaker**  ; but the plant at 7LA is obsolete equipment transferred from 3LO. Moreover, the studio in Hobart is situated in an old and generally unsuitable building. I trust that the Acting Treasurer will bring under the notice of the PostmasterGeneral the request that more modern facilities be provided. 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">Acting Treasurer &middot; Kooyong &middot; UAP</small>

-- I have a great deal of sympathy with what has been said by the honorable member for Denison  **(Mr. Mahoney)**  and the honorable member for Bass  **(Mr. Barnard).**  I shall convey their requests, which support requests previously made by practically every T as.manian representative, under the notice of the Postmaster-General. 

Question resolved in the affirmative.

### PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT CHARGES BILL 1937. -


 *In Committee of Ways and Means: .* 


##### Mr THORBY:<br><small class="text-muted">Assistant Minister for Commerce &middot; Calarc &middot; CP</small>

-- I move - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. That, subject to a lower rate being prescribed by regulations made under the Primary Produce Export Charges Act 1935, as amended by the act passed to give effect to this resolution, in respect of any of the kinds of primary produce to which that act, as so amended, applies, a charge, at the rates hereunder respectively specified, shall, on and after a date to be fixed by proclamation issued under the act passed to give effect to this resolution be imposed on the following primary produce exported from the Commonwealth to any place other than the United Kingdom or the Continent of Europe: - 

On fresh apples. - Per case, two half-cases ov three trays, three-eighths of one penny. 

On fresh pears. - Per case, two half-cases or three trays, three-eighths of one penny. 

{: type="1" start="2"}
0. That, where the Governor-General has, by order published in the  *Gazette,*  after report to tho Minister by any organization prescribed by the regulations tinder the Primary Produce Export Charges Act 1935, or under that act as amended by the act passed to give effect to this resolution, exempted, cither unconditionally, or subject to such conditions or in respect of such period (if any) as wore specified in the order of exemption, any primary produce to which the Primary Produce Export. Charges Act 1935, as amended by thu act passed to give effect to this resolution, applies, from the charges imposed by or under that act as so amended, the Governor-General may, by order published in the  *Gazette,*  cancel the exemption and thereupon those charges shall, from the dato fixed by the order, become payable iti respect of that kind of primary produce. 

The Government regrets that it is necessary to submit the resolution, in which no vital principle is involved, at this stage. The object is merely to extend the levy of three-eighths of a penny a case now imposed on apples and pears exported to the United Kingdom and other European countries, to apples and pears exported to all countries. Under existing conditions no levy is chargeable on apples and pears exported to countries other than those mentioned. This causes difficulty in ascertaining whether the fruit may be going to a destination where the charge would be leviable or to some port where it would be exempt. The apple and pear council have made strong representations to the Government to amend the Primary Produce Export Charges Act to make a uniform charge on all apples and pears exported from the Commonwealth. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">FREMANTLE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1934; ALP from 1936</small>

--  Regardless of their destination ? 

##### Mr THORBY:

-- Yes. This proposal, if adopted will avoid difficulty at the port or country to which the produce is being exported. Moreover, we have been advised by the Crown Law authorities that the present system is likely to cause some difficulty in connexion with trade treaties and our trade relations generally with other countries, because there is differentiation in respect of apples and pears. 

##### Mr SCULLIN:<br><small class="text-muted">YARRA, VICTORIA</small>

-- How has this position arisen ? 

##### Mr THORBY:

-- When the principal act was passed practically all apples and pears exported from Australia were consigned to the United Kingdom or to European countries, hut since then consignments have been despatched to other destinations. This amendment has been sought by the industry. The imposition of a levy will increase the funds of the council and enable further advertising and publicity work to be undertaken, particularly overseas. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Fremantle</small>

.- The explanation which the Assistant Minister for Commerce  **(Mr. Thorby)**  has given should commend the proposal to the. committee; but I enter a most emphatic protest against the manner in which the business has been introduced. No intimation of any kind was given to me concerning ' this resolution, and I frankly object to the procedure which has been adopted. Some of the measures which in a general way are noncontentious have to be disposed of somewhat hurriedly to facilitate administration; but this weakness in the existing law must have been discovered some time ago. The ordinary procedure- in connexion with the imposition of the levy ought to be adhered to as far as possible. E cannot exonerate Ministers from the charge of having treated honorable members discourteously. I have agreed to the passage of some of the' bills which appear on the notice-paper, because we have had an opportunity to study them. We have refrained from debating them because we did not wish to delay the business of the House. Although the explanation of the Assistant Minister appears satisfactory, it might be found, if more time were available, that this motion is unnecessary. I am under the impression that originally this matter was dealt with somewhat burriedly with the result that Parliament failed to make the imposition general.  *I*  do not know whether there will be any serious breakdown in the working of the act if this matter be deferred until Parliament re-assembles; if no inconvenience will arise it should be deferred. If, on the contrary, the Assistant Minister can assure me that some grievous harm will result to the exporters, owing to a new trade having developed which is outside the scope of the levy imposed under our existing legislation, I am prepared to support the motion. I cannot accept responsibility for this type of legislation because I have not had an opportunity to study its purport. 

##### Mr GREGORY:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

.- I have no objection to the bill. Western Australian primary producers are exporting large quantities of fruit to India, on which this export levy will be imposed. 

On many occasions I have strongly urged the Government to enter into negotiations with India in an endeavour to obtain some tariff concession to enable us to extend our trade with that country. At present there is a duty of 30 per cent, on fruit and vegetables imported into India and American and Japanese exporters can secure the best of the market. The Government should be able to enter into a trade agreement with India under which the Western Australian primary producers will be able to get a larger share of the trade with that country. 

##### Mr White:

--  It has tried; we cannot even get the British preferential rate. 

##### Mr GREGORY:

-- The only report received dealt with trade between the eastern States of Australia and India. No reference was made in that report to trade between Western Australia and India. If the Government would give consideration to the request some benefit might accrue. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Franklin</small>

.- I am quite in accord with the principle of the bill. I agree with the honorable member for Swan  **(Mr. Gregory)**  that something should be done to increase our trade with India and the East. The Tasmanian fruit-growers have been unable to execute many orders received from the East .for fruit, because suitable shipping space has not been available. Consequently, a profitable market has been lost. When I and a number of other members of this chamber were in England some time ago, representatives of India informed us that a considerable trade in Australian fruit could be developed with that, country, if it could be placed on the Indian market at a reasonable price. 

##### Mr MAHONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Denison</small>

.- I support the remarks of the honorable member for Franklin  **(Mr. Frost).**   The growers of apples in Tasmania' produce remarkably good crops, but frequently thousands of cases of fruit cannot be marketed because of lack of shipping space, and the fruit is left to rot on the ground. Apple-growing under scientific methods is of no use unless active steps are taken to assist the orchardists to find profitable markets for their produce. This year one of the biggest crops iii the history of the State was grown, but the 

##### Mr Thorby:

--  By this bill the Government is giving more than consideration to the growers. 

##### Mr MAHONEY:

-- I commend ' the Ministry for the assistance which  will be  given under this measure, but the growers require further assistance so that they will not be placed in the position of having thousands of cases of fruit left on their hands. The honorable member for Franklin has mentioned that apples could have been sent to India this year had shipping space been available. The Government should endeavour to see that the "growers have sufficient freight space allotted to them to enable them to export their fruit - to . any part of the world where it can be marketed. The growers are struggling against great natural disadvantages. 'A -government that allowed them to suffer the hardship of having to leave, their fruit to rot in the orchards would . deserve strong condemnation. 

##### Mr HAWKER:<br><small class="text-muted">Wakefield</small>

.- The difficulty referred to by the Assistant Minister for Commerce '  **(Mr. Thorby)**  in explaining the necessity for this bill should obviously be rectified. Probably the growers desire to have it rectified, but this fact scarcely excuses the Government for bringing the measure forward at this stage of the session^ without previous warning to the 'committee, and asking it to pass the bill in a few minutes. Almost every session a few small bills are submitted immediately before the Parliament rises, which, no doubt, could have been introduced earlier. Although I do not intend to exercise my right as a private member to obstruct the passage of this bill, because I consider it to be a. noncontentious and manifestly desirable one, I should be sorry to assist in establishing a . precedent . that private members generally should be expected to give their consent, on behalf of their constituents, to measures introduced in these circumstances, seeing that no time is available

Whilst I regret that it was necessary to bring up this bill without the customary notice, I have given a clear explanation as to why this course was necessary. The measure is a non-contentious one.

This bill merely extends the principle to apples and pears exported to any part of the world.

#### Canberra Hospital: Report of Royal

Commission -AirMail Services : Position of Western Aubtralia - Sittings of Parliament. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Menzies)**  proposed - 

  >That the House do now adjourn. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Fremantle</small>

.- I desire to direct attention to the report tabled to-day of the royal commissioners who inquired into certain matters remitted to them in respect of the Canberra hospital. I have had no time to peruse it in detail, but I am astonished to find that the commission reports that it had much evidence which would enable it to bring forward a more critical report, and is prepared to do so should the occasion ever arise. It seems to me that the commissioners contemplated furnishing a sort of Kathleen Mavourneen report if the Minister for Health  **(Mr. Hughes)**  desires that to be done. I ask the right honorable gentleman does he not consider that the public interest demands that the various matters remitted to the royal commissioners for decision should be at least the subject of some indication of what they consider the weight of evidence warranted them deciding. A perusal of the report leaves me the impression that the commissioners have put the interests of a group of medical men before the public interest, and that they have shown a certain amount of bias by their attitude. The report of the proceedings before the commission which appeared in the press suggested, too, that certain evidence that could not be regarded as coming within the meaning of the terms of strictly medical testimony - by that I mean the discussion of matters which would he private as between a medical practitioner and his or her patient - had not been made available to the public. The commissioners say that there are matters which they could deal with more critically than they have done, and they invite the Government to say whether or not this more critical report should be furnished. Does the Minister intend to invite the commission to make a more complete report? Broadly speaking, it appears to me that the commission has abandoned the terms of reference. I direct attention in this connexion to paragraph 14 of the terms of reference which reads as follows: - 

  >To inquire into and determine whetherowing to gossip or criticism emanating from the Canberra Government Hospital any honorary medical officer has been compelled in selfdefence to perform unnecessarily major operation on a patient critically ill. 

The comment which the commission makes is as follows: - 

  >The commission is of the opinion that in spite of adverse criticism of whatsoever nature, no medical officer of any institution should perform an operation which he considers unnecessary if his judgment dictates otherwise. 

That appears to me to be rather a ridiculous observation. It does not answer the question contained in the terms of reference as to whether this was or was not done, and it goes on to say that no medical officer ought to perform an operation unless he thinks it is necessary. I could say that myself without evidence or inquiry. I do not know what the Minister thinks about it, but the report gives me the impression of being vague and unsatisfactory. Either those matters which he remitted to the commissioners were matters which they should decide upon, or else there should have been no inquiry at all. That appears to sum up the situation. I ask the right honorable gentleman whether he intends to direct the commission to furnish this more critical report which the commissioners say they are in a position to submit? 

I also desire to refer to a matter which was raised by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie  **(Mr. A. Green)**  in connexion with air routes in Western Australia which may be affected as a result of the conclusion of the overseas air-mail agreement. I point out that the commercial air routes in Western Australia have been developed very considerably under the stimulus of the postal services which they were able to associate with passenger traffic. I also remind honorable members that the Western Australian air services were among the first of the Australian aerial services, and that with the exception of the East- West service they have not been dependent on Commonwealth subventions to any material extent. These aerial services traverse a portion of Australia which cannot be adequately served by a sea-service because of the cost, the comparatively limited population and the small amount of traffic, although the State Government has an excellent shipping service, and private companies are also operating in conjunction with the State service. The shipping services are adequate for the requirements of the present sea-borne trade, but the gaps between the sailings are many and delays in connexion with transportation of passengers and of mails by sea are out of keeping with the modern conception of what is required. It is impracticable to service this immense territory by railways or roads. If we look at the map particularly of the north-west of "Western Australia, having regard to its distance from Perth and the fact that that country is an important part of the territory of Australia, we realize that we must do our utmost, not only to preserve such settlement as is there, but also to encourage even more settlement. I hope that the deep significance of aerial services in that connexion will be appreciated by the Govern^ ment. These services are being rendered by private enterprise - I say that merely to state the fact - and should the diversion of the overseas air-mail service result in the Western Australian overseas mail arriving at Adelaide or at any other capital of the eastern States, the gravest injury will be done to the Western Australian aerial services north of Perth. Probably, almost certainly, an advantage will be given to the East- West air service ; but the general impression in Western Australia is that the round-about route down to Adelaide, and then west to Perth, would mean the retrogression of the service, even as it now stands, with respect to overseas mails. I invite the Acting Leader of the House  **(Mr. Menzies)**  to give consideration to the representations that have been made in this matter. I have merely amplified what the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has said. I feel confident that the whole of the representation of Western Australia in this Parliament, regardless of party, will agree with the views that I have expressed. 

##### Mr NAIRN:<br><small class="text-muted">Perth</small>

.- I support the remarks of the Leader' of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin).**  Earlier in th, day I asked the Acting Prime Minister  **(Dr. Earle Page)**  as to whether the Government would consider the completion of the existing service on the northwest coast of Western Australia. The proposal, as I understand it, is that, commencing about January, 1938, there will be a tri-weekly overseas service from Darwin to London. It has been suggested that mails from and to Western Australia will be carried through either Adelaide or Sydney. The result of the adoption of that proposal would be loss of time in the delivery of overseas mails in Western Australia. I urge upon the Government the extension of the north-west service. At present, the route is from Perth to Wyndham. 

##### Mr Hawker:

-- And on to Daly Waters. 

##### Mr NAIRN:

-- To complete the service, only an additional 200 miles at most would have to be flown. That would not be a serious matter from the viewpoint of expense, but, on the other hand, the additional service would be of great importance. I feel with the Leader of the Opposition that, if the north-west service loses the transport of overseas mails to Western Australia, it is likely to become unprofitable and deteriorate, probably into a weekly service. That would bc very much against the interests not only of the people of the north-west, but also of the defence of Australia. There are Very strong reasons for continuing and, indeed, improving the service on the north-west coast. 

##### Mr STREET:<br><small class="text-muted">Corangamite</small>

.- I wish to draw attention to a matter which I believe is responsible for a certain degree of dissatisfaction among honorable members generally; I refer to the sitting periods of this Parliament. It should be possible for the Government so to arrange its business that this House would sit for definite periods. For example, it might sit in March, April and May, and then adjourn until the middle of August, when it could sit until it had disposed of its business. I realize, of course, that, in a state of emergency, it could be called together immediately. 

All honorable members, I think, "will agree that if Parliament were to lay it down that the sittings should be during certain specified months, it would function more effectively and the work would lie done in a more 'businesslike manner, in Victoria, the State Parliament sits (.luring the last six months of the year. Chat might not bc altogether suitable for Canberra, because of the severity of the winter months here, but I do think that honorable members should be able to see sufficiently far ahead to know when Parliament would meet. That would give them a far better opportunity than they now have to deal with the innumerable reports that they receive. Under the present system, which would seem to be not a system, but merely a haphazard method of meeting from time to time, I believe that Parliament is not capable of exercising properly its deliberative functions. I, therefore, hope that the Government will investigate the possibility of the institution of a system such as I have suggested, and, should the improbable occur, and the Treasury bench  bp.  occupied by another party, that party should make the investigation. I am sure that action along these lines would meet with the approval of all honorable members. 

##### Mr HAWKER:<br><small class="text-muted">Wakefield</small>

.- 1 rise to address myself to the subject that has been brought before the House  by  the Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Perth  **(Mr. Nairn),**  and, earlier, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie  **(Mr. A. Green).** 

I wish to draw a very definite distinction between the reasonable request from South Australia, which has the support of, and is being strongly pressed by, every honorable member from that State, for a direct connexion with" the overseas air mail service, and the extended request - I do not know whether it has actually been brought before the Government, but  it  has received a certain amount of publicity in South Australia - that the mails for Western Australia should be diverted through Adelaide. As a South Australian, t he latter request appears to me to be quite an unfair one. I, with probably every other honorable member from South Australia, dissociate myself from any request which would have the effect of damaging the existing service on the north-west coast of Western Australia, where there are so few alternative services, and any service with proper ground organization to support it is so valuable to the supervision, and probably the protection, of the coastline in that part of Australia. 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Health &middot; North Sydney &middot; UAP</small>

.- The Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin)**  has directed attention to the report that I tabled to-day of the Hospital Commission, which was asked to conduct an inquiry into the dispute at the Canberra Community Hospital. The honorable gentleman is not satisfied with that report, although it has very much to recommend it.  I  am sure he will appreciate the fact that it is at all times possible to present a report that will attract the attention of the multitude and be regarded as a credit to those who make it, but it is not so easy to do what this commission ' was expected to do, namely, make a report on the evidence and at the same time enable the hospital to carry on as an institution for the benefit of the people of Canberra. 

The honorable gentleman referred to the evidence. I have not read it, but the report states, at page 1, that  36  witnesses were examined on oath and  297  pages of evidence were taken. As I have said I have not informed my mind on that evidence, but I shall have an opportunity to do so in the days that are to come. Whether, as a result, I shall conclude that the report presented is something short of perfection remains to he seen. At the moment, I am not prepared to say more than this: The report clears up one or two points that were seriously disturbing the minds of the people of Canberra. These are referred to in paragraphs  5  and  6  of the terms of reference to the commission which were as follows: - 

  >To inquire into and determine why so many patients, especially poor patients, refuse point blank to enter the Canberra Community Hospital although in many cases contributing towards its upkeep. 
  >
  >To inquire- into and determine whether or not there are at the moment patients critically ill and chronically ill in homes totally unable to provide nursing and/or hygienic services who refuse for definite and specific reasons to enter the Canberra Community Hospital. 

That is a serious charge. The commission's answer, which is very definite, and appears to me to  be  quite satisfactory, is - 

{: type="A" start="A"}
0. number of patients gave evidence to the effect that they wouid not enter the Canberra Community Hospital, but the commission has experienced many similar expressions of complaint about many hospitals and is of the opinion that the reasons advanced by these patients for refusal to enter were not justified. 

The honorable member will appreciate that the members of this commission  Avere  trained to weigh and estimate the value of evidence given in such an inquiry as that which occupied their attention in Canberra. 

Mr.Curtin.  -  They were medical practitioners, not legal practitioners, and were not more trained to weigh evidence than we are. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

--  I do not propose to argue the matter at length. I point out, however, that internees of a hospital and nursing staff and doctors, are an isolated community engaged in absorbing  duties  in a somewhat depressing atmosphere, in which there is a tendency to friction. Trifles are magnified, personal feelings and likes and dislikes are intensified, and colour their outlook and affect their relations in a way thatwould not occur in a larger community. The smaller the hospital and community, the more likely such troubles are to arise. The commission that visited Canberra has visited  many  hospitals  in  which similar  disputes  have occurred. The paragraph of the report referred to by the Leader of the Opposition reads - 

  >The commission has much evidence which would enable it to bring forward a more critical report and is prepared to do so should the occasion ever arise. The commission, however, takes the view that the present spirit of conciliatory co-operation should be fostered and developed by the spirit of ito comments and takes pleasure in publishing a helpful and constructive, rather than a critical, report. 

I do not see anything there suggestive of Kathleen Mavourneen. All that the commission says is, "Do not do  it  again. Tf you behave yourselves like good children, thingswill be all  right;  otherwise, look out." That is my interpretation of what the commission said. 

##### Mr Curtin:

-- To whom is that said? Is it said to the department controlling the hospital, to the board members, to the medical officers in attendance, or to the patients? Who is not to do it again, whatever that is? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

--  The hospital  has  been established primarily for the benefit of the patients. The doctors are there to minister to the patients, merely accessories for their benefit to alleviate their sufferings and, if possible, curetheir ills. The governing principle is that  the  hospital exists for the benefit of the patients. I shall see that that is upheld. I do not pretend to defend anything that has been done which conflicts with that principle. No doubt things have been done  Avhich  should not have been done. The commission was asked - 

  >To inquire into and determine whether, owing to gossip or criticism emanating from the Canberra Government Hospital any honorary medical officer has been compelled in self defence to perform unnecessarily major operation on a patient critically ill. 

Mr.SCULLIN.  -  Did it do so? 

##### Mr Curtin:

--  At any rate, it did not answer the question. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

--  I agree with the comment of the Leader of the Opposition on that point, but the commission did say - 

  >The commission is of the opinion that in spite of adverse criticism of whatsoever nature., no medical officer of any institution should perform an operation which he considers unnecessary if his judgment dictates otherwise. 

##### Mr Curtin:

--  If the  right,  honorable gentlemen were on trial for murder, and I  Avere  the  jury, itwould  not be sufficient for me to say " You should not commit  murder ". 

##### Mr HUGHES:

--  If a patient goes to "  **Dr. Blank**  " who diagnoses his troubleas appendicitis, and finds, on removing the appendix, that  it  is perfectly good" and healthy, he is undoubtedly liable under the section ! In other words, as  in,  cooking, the proof of the  pudding  is  in  the eating of  it.  Everythingwould depend upon the state of the appendix. 

However, I shall communicate the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition to- 

  >
 **Dr. Colvin** and ask why it was thought inadvisable for the commission to submit a report on the evidence to which reference is made. For the rest, I am most loathe to do anything at all that will fan these dying embers into a blaze again. I am here as the guardian of the patients, and the board has been appointed to consider the well-being of the patients and to administer the affairs of the hospital with that object in view. Medical officers, of course, have their rights, and it is perfectly proper for the British Medical Association to see that they are protected. My position is different. With other honorable members here, I represent the people at large. Our business is to see that their interests are protected, and we shall doubtless do it. 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; Kooyong &middot; UAP</small>

.- The Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin),**  the honorable member for Perth  **(Mr. Nairn),**  and the honorable member for Wakefield  **(Mr. Hawker)**  - 

##### Mr Prowse:

--  I am with them  too. 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- I add, in spirit, the honorable member for Forrest  **(Mr. Prowse),**  referred to aerial services of Western Australia. I assure those honorable gentlemen that the great force of their observation is fully appreciated. All the considerations to which they referred are being borne in mind, by the Government in arranging the details of these services. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

House adjourned at5.49 p.m. until a date and hour to be fixed by  **Mr. Speaker.**
