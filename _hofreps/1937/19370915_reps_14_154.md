#### OIL IK DUTCH NEW GUINEA

##### Mr BEASLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">WEST SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Can the Prime Minister mention to the House the name of the Minister who was in charge of the administration of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea on the 30th January, 1934, and the 30th June, 1934, when reports were submitted in regard to the discovery of flow oil in Dutch New Guinea ? 

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; WILMOT, TASMANIA &middot; UAP</small>

-- The Minister in charge of Territories when the report of the 30th January, 1934, was received,' was the honorable member for Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr),**  and the Minister in charge of Territories when the report of the 30th June, 1934, was received, was  **Senator Sir Harry**  Lawson. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Can the Prime Minister make available the reports submitted in January and June, 1934, by the Administrator of the Territory of New Guinea in regard to the discovery of flow oil in Dutch New Guinea ? 

##### Mr LYONS:

-- The honorable gentleman would he nearer the mark if he framed his question by using the words " suggested discovery of oil ". I shall be glad to make the report available to the honorable gentleman. I go' further than that and say that the honorable member may, if he desires, have access to the files dealing with the matter.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-3-0}
#### CANBERRA

Revaluations - Unemployment - WorkingHours of Shop Assistants. 

##### Mr PERKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">EDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Can the Minister for the Interior say on what basis the revaluations of properties in Canberra are made for rating purposes? Is the honorable gentleman aware that in some recent cases rates were advanced by 75 per cent., and caused bitter dissatisfaction? Is there any authority to which onappeal may be made? 

##### Mr PATERSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for the Interior &middot; GIPPSLAND, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- I cannot give the exact details as to the basis that is observed but it is in accordance with the law. Revaluations for rating purposes are made each year, but they do not involve rentals. I assure the honorable gentleman that, on the whole, the reductions have exceeded the increases, particularly in districts in which the people are less able to pay - for example in an area such as Ainslie. 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">CAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Is it true that the Minister for the Interior refused to meet . a deputation of representatives of the unemployed in Canberra during the last couple of days? Will' the honorable gentleman give the assurance that he will meet such a deputation before he leaves Canberra ? 

##### Mr PATERSON:

-- It is not true that I refused to meet this deputation. I have never refused to meet a deputation since I have been the Minister for the Interior. I was unable to arrange to meet representatives of the unemployed either last night or to-night, but I have written to them stating that I shall be glad to endeavour to meet them in the near future. 

##### Mr PERKINS:

-- Is the AttorneyGeneral aware that while shop assistants in Queanbeyan and New South Wales generally work a 44-hour week, in the Federal Capital Territory they are obliged to work a 46-hour week? It is possible for the right honorable gentleman to take steps to bring about uniformity? 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">Attorney-General &middot; KOOYONG, VICTORIA &middot; UAP</small>

-- I have this matter under consideration at the present time.

### MAJOR OIL COMPANIES

{:#subdebate-4-0}
#### Supplies of Petrol to Traders

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:<br><small class="text-muted">DALLEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-I have received from a garage proprietor in my electorate a letter in which he says - 

  >I should like to draw your attention, as federal member,to the penalization of my garage business by the major oil companies. The Shell, Commonwealth Oil Refineries and Vacuum Oil companies refuse to supply  *me*  at wholesale rates, which I as a reseller am entitled to, unlessI raise the independent oil company's prices to their level. 

In view of this evidence, and of similar evidence that was submitted to the Royal Commission on Petrol, has the Government done anything, or does it propose to do anything, in regard to the penalizing of traders by the major oil companies? 

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- If the honorable memberwill supply me with full details, I shall be glad to look into the matter.

#### AUSTRALIAN AIR LEAGUE

##### Mr E J HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP; LP from 1944</small>

-- I introduced recently to the then Acting Minister for Defence  **(Mr. Thorby)**  a deputation from the Australian Air League, which stated a strong case for consideration by the Government of a grant to help it to continue the preliminary training of youths in all matters pertaining to aviation. Has the Minister for Defence  **(Sir Archdale Parkhill)**  considered the request of that deputation? If so, will he give the assurance that a grant will be made to assist the league to continue the good work in which it is engaged ? 

##### Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Defence &middot; WARRINGAH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-I have not had an opportunity to study the papers in connexion with the deputation that waited on the Acting Minister for Defence during my absence abroad, but I am aware of the enthusiasm which this organization has displayed and of the. considerable amount of patriotic service that a number of people are rendering in regard to it. I have ascertained that there is no provision on the Estimates for the granting of assistance, and I am exploring other avenues to see whether there is some fund operated by the department from which assistance may be given.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-6-0}
#### TIMBER IMPORTS

##### Mr SCULLY:<br><small class="text-muted">GWYDIR, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs been drawn to a recent press report which read - 

  >With timber from the Pacific Coast, at least 30 vessels are expected at Sydney by December, according to advices received by shipping men. They will discharge more than 100,000,000 feet of lumber, and relieve the shortage which has developed in the local market. 

Is the Minister aware that a large number of the timber mills of New South "Wales  are at present idle, that others are working only part time, and that very few are working full time? Will he take steps to prevent the dumping of timber from overseas, as it will cause wholesale unemployment in the timber industry throughout Australia? 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- I am not aware that the position is as the honorable member has stated it to be. In fact, in Adelaide at the moment there is a considerable scarcity of both Australian and imported timber. From several firms in Adelaide, I have received to-day telegrams on the subject passed on to me by honorable members representing constituencies in South Australia. Prior to the entry of the honorable member intothis House, the Government raised the duties on Oregon logs. This proved most effective in the direction of increasing the volume of work in Australian mills. The files in the Department of Trade and Customs contain correspondence from the Hardwood Millers' Association of Victoria, expressing approval of that action of the Government, and stating that it had accelerated work in all the Australian mills. If the honorable member can prove to me that there is one mill that is slack, I shall be very greatly surprised.

#### NORTHERN TERRITORY

Visit by Prime Minister - Election - Railway Employees - Topographical Survey - Land Resumption for Naval Purposes. 

##### Mr BLAIN:<br><small class="text-muted">NORTHERN TERRITORY</small>

-- No Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has yet set foot in the Northern Territory. Will the right honorable member for Wilmot  **(Mr. Lyons)**  accept, through me, an invitation from the people of the Northern Territory to be the first Prime Minister to do so - after the next elections? 

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- As the " then " Prime Minister, I accept the invitation of the " then " honorable member for the Northern Territory. 

I take this opportunity to reply to a question that the honorable member asked yesterday concerning the date of the election for the Northern Territory, in which he is directly interested. The issue of the writ will be on the 24th September; nominations will close on the 2nd October; polling day will be on the 30th October - one week later than the date of the general elections throughout Australia; and the writs will be returnable on or before the 31st December. 

##### Mr BLAIN:

-- In view of the harmony that now exists in the Commonwealth 

Railways service between Alice Springs and Kalgoorlie as the result of the officers being granted the right to approach the Public Service Arbitrator, will the Minister for the Interior confer with the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner with the idea of giving a similar right to the men stationed further north around Darwin? 

##### Mr PATERSON:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

-- I shall discuss the honorable member's suggestion with the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. 

##### Mr BLAIN:

-- In view of the difficulty of officers and men of the garrison at Darwin in going inland to gain a knowledge of the country in which they might be required to deploy, I ask the Minister for Defence if a branch of the survey corps could not be established in Darwin so that thorough topographical maps might be prepared? 

##### Mr PATERSON:<br><small class="text-muted">GIPPSLAND, VICTORIA &middot; CP from 1922; ST CP from 1937; LCP from 1940</small>

-- I shall have consideration given to the representations and. suggestions of the honorable member. 

##### Mr BLAIN:

-- I have just received a telegram from a Chinese merchant at Darwin who has been compelled by the Department of the Interior more or less to rebuild. He has £4,000 worth of material on the ground, and fears that the Department of Defence may decide to resume the land for naval requirements. Will the Minister for the Interior announce as early as possible the land that will be required for naval purposes? 

##### Mr PATERSON:

-- The information will be made available as soon as possible.

### QUESTION

#### GALVANIZED IRON

##### Mr McCLELLAND:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA</small>

-- Is the Minister for Trade and Customs aware of the extreme shortage of galvanized iron throughout Australia? What steps, if any, does he propose to take to ensure that ample supplies shall be made available? 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- There has been a shortage of galvanized iron in Australia from time to time. To relieve it, I have approved during the last two years of the by-law admission of English iron to a value of nearly £300,000. 

##### Mr Prowse:

-- On behalf of the manufacturers or the public? 

##### Mr WHITE:

-- The public, of course, including the wheat-growers; that is, through merchants, British iron imported into Australia to-day is dearer than Australian galvanized iron; consequently, although it may be imported free of duty, merchants are not purchasing it, and therefore the shortage of supplies persists. The local manufacturing establishments have, however, been considerably extended, . and it is hoped that the requirements of the public will quickly be overhauled. The demand, of course, has been very considerably accelerated by reason of the extensive building operations that have been conducted during the last five years.

#### NICKEL COINAGE

##### Mr JAMES:<br><small class="text-muted">HUNTER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Will the Treasurer state whether it is true, as is reported in the press, that the Government is considering the introduction of a nickel coin to replace the present copper coinage in Australia? If so, does not the honorable gentleman consider that, as nickel is not produced in Australia, the adoption of such a course would be to the detriment of the coppermining industry, and would cause additional unemployment? 

##### Mr Lyons:

-- Nickel is produced in Tasmania. 

##### Mr CASEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; CORIO, VICTORIA &middot; UAP</small>

-- The Government has not actually had the matter under consideration; but I have considered it personally. I do not think that the quantity of copper absorbed in our coinage is of very great moment to the copper -mining industry of Australia.

#### AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION

Studio Building Programme - Additional Station for Adelaide

##### Mr MAHONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">DENISON, TASMANIA</small>

-- Has the Minister representing the Postmaster-General yet received a report from the Australian Broadcasting Commission in reference to the Hobart studio? 


 **Sir ARCHDALE** PARKHILL.The provision of broadcasting studios is an obligation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, from which body the following advice has been received :  - 

  >The Commonwealth architect, who has been in consultation with  **Mr. Bearup**  of the commission's staff, and officers of the PostmasterGeneral's technical staff, is preparing sketch plans of the proposed new Sydney building. 
  >
  >These plans, with estimates, will be submitted to the commission at its meeting in the first week of October. Naturally, some months will elapse between the commission's inspection of the sketch plans and the actual commencement of building operations, and it may well be two years or more from now before the building is completed. It is proposed to start on the plans for the Melbourne building as soon as the construction of the Sydney building has begun, so that building operations will proceed simultaneously in both cities, though the Melbourne building may not be completed until some months after Sydney. 
  >
  >Regarding the other States, the commission has not yet decided whether it will proceed with the building in Hobart before Adelaide, Brisbane or Perth. In any case, it is not likely that the building in one or other of these capital cities will be started until the Melbourne and Sydney buildings are at least nearing completion. In view of this, there is no urgent need for the commission to decide immediately what the order of construction will he. 

##### Mr STACEY:<br><small class="text-muted">ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Can the Minister representing the Postmaster-General inform the House when the Australian Broadcasting Commission will proceed with the provision of an additional A class broadcasting station at Adelaide? 

##### Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- I shall endeavour to obtain the required information from the Australian Broadcasting Commission.

#### MINERAL RESOURCES SURVEY

##### Mr DRAKEFORD:<br><small class="text-muted">MARIBYRNONG, VICTORIA</small>

-- Can the Prime Minister statewhen the survey now being made of the iron ore and other mineral resources of Australia will be completed? If it is completed prior to the reassembly of Parliament, will it be possible for the results to be made available to honorable members who desire it? 

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- The survey referred to by the honorable gentleman must not be superficial, as was the first survey. Therefore, I cannot give any indication how long it will take for it to be completed. If the survey is to be complete and comprehensive, however, it will take some considerable time, and I doubt whether the results will be available within the next few weeks.

#### PACIFIC SHIPPING

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minis ter &middot; WILMOT, TASMANIA &middot; ALP; UAP from 1931</small>

--  *by leave*  - The question of maintaining British liner shipping on the route between Canada, New Zealand and Australia was discussed during the Imperial Conference by representatives of the governments concerned - the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - and these discussions have since been continued. As a result, the Commonwealth Government has decided that, subject to a satisfactory agreement being reached with the shipping company concerned as to terms and extent of assistance, the Government is prepared to recommend to Parliament that it join with the other governments in a scheme for co-operation in financial measures to enable two new liners to be built for the service. 

As at present contemplated, these measures would take the form of a government guarantee of a loan to be raised by the shipping company for the purpose of constructing the vessels. The terms of the proposed financial assistance have been incorporated in a draft agreement with which the Commonwealth Government is in accord. This has been fully discussed with the company, but there are still points outstanding and, consequently, it is not possible to introduce legislation this session. 


 *Later:* 


##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- What steps can the interested parties, particularly the men employed in Pacific shipping, take to preserve their interests under any agreement which may be arrived at in pursuance of the proposed subsidizing of British shipping in the Pacific? My* question refers to manning, docking and the supply of provisions which are now done through Australian sources, but which may not be so done under a new agreement. I desire to see that the interests of these persons are safeguarded. 

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- No action by the men is required because the Government- is doing everything necessary to safeguard their interests.

##### Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- Thu position in regard to this matter has been explained already in this House both by the Prime Minister and by myself. The Government is in favour of the decentralization of munition works, and is prepared in connexion with any new works to endeavour to give effect to that policy; but it is not prepared to construct new works where an annex or an addition to existing works can be economically carried out to effect what is required. Consequently, there is no provision at the moment for any works in the other States regarding munitions generally, although the position is being explored to see if some work connected with the department can be done in States other than those in which munitions work is already being carried on.

Have you, sir, called for a report from the Trade and Customs Department as to whether the statements contained in that reply are true? Will you make a statement to the effect that refrigerators are completely made here, and are just as efficient as the imported article ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- A full statement on the subject is being furnished to the Premier of Tasmania, in which it is being pointed out that special stamps are issued only in connexion with big national events. The departure from this rule at the time the telephone cable was laid between the mainland and Tasmania, when a special stamp was issued, was for the purpose of informing the world that Tasmania was now connected with the mainland by telephone cable. That was a very special case. The Postmaster-General's Department feels that it would not be advisable to issue a special stamp in connexion with the Royal Hobart Centenary Regatta. The proposal that an advertisement of the event should be authorized on envelopes is being considered.

### COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1937

Motion (by Dr.Earle Page) agreed to- 

  >That he have leave to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1922-l936, in relation to the recognition of certain prior service as Commonwealth service. 

Bill brought up, and read a first time. 

{:#subdebate-27-0}
#### Second Reading

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Commerce &middot; Co wper &middot; CP</small>

--  *by leave*  -I move - 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

The object of this bill is to overcome the hardship suffered by certain officers of the Commonwealth Public Service by reason of their service with the Development and Migration Commission. The Development and Migration Act 1926, made provision for the preservation of the existing and. accruing rights of Commonwealth and State public servants appointed to the staff of the commission, but did not specify what those rights were. In 1928, the Officers' Rights Declaration Act was passed specifying the rights preserved to Commonwealth officers appointed to the staff of the commission, but no action was taken to specify the rights of State officers appointed to it. This bill indicates the rights which it. was intended to preserve to State officers under the Development and Migration Act. 

Under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, an officer of the State Public Service who transfers to the Commonwealth Public Service is entitled to have the period of his employment by the State counted for the purposes of computing sick leave and furlough, provided,  of course, that his service with the State and the Commonwealth is continuous. 

In the case of certain officers whose service with a State, with the Development and Migration Commission, and subsequently with the Commonwealth Public Service has been continuous, the period during which they were on the staff of the commission represents, under the law as it now stands, a break in such continuity. This means that for purposes of sick leave and furlough, the service of these officers is regarded as having commenced only from the date of their appointment to the Commonwealth Public Service after the abolition of the Development and Migration Commission. 

##### Mr Forde:

--  How many officers are affected ? 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:

-- Three. This bill is designed to remedy the unsatisfactory position in which they find themselves. 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Capricornia</small>

.- As this bill makes provision for recognizing the rights of certain public servants and is reasonable, the Opposition will not oppose it. 

Mr.Beasley.  -What  are the names of the officers concerned ? 

##### Dr Earle Page:

--  Messrs. J. A. W. Stevenson, C. H. Cox, andN. W. Lamidy, who were appointed to the commission to make special investigation into certain aspects of our primary producing industries are now continuing their work as officers of the Commerce Department. 

Question resolved in the affirmative.

### DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT CHARGES BILL 1937

--  I move - 

That the bill be  now  read  a  second time. 

This is a very short bill of only one clause of any consequence. By an amendment of the Dairy Produce Control Act 1935, the name of the board appointed under the principal act was altered from the Dairy Produce Control Board to the 

Australian Dairy Produce Board. In the Dairy Produce Export Charges Act 1924-1929, the old name still appears and this amendment is necessary to alter it. In 1936, the levy under this act was amended on the recommendation of the Australian Dairy Produce Board, although the Dairy Produce Export Charges Act at that time provided that the recommendation should be by the Dairy Produce Control Board. The present amending bill, besides providing for the alteration of the name of the board, validates the action taken in 1936. 

Mr.Forde. -  Was the industry consulted  on  this subject? 

##### Mr THORBY:

-- Yes. The present board is quite in accordance with this proposal which is, in fact, necessary. It is merely a technical amendment, and I give honorable members a definite assurance that no principle is involved. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time and reported  from  committee without amendment  or  debate; report adopted.

At the end of last session the Wine Overseas Marketing Act 1929-36 was amended to provide, among other things, for a change of designation of the Wine Overseas Marketing Board to the Australian Wine Board. Consequently, it has been found necessary to amend the Wine Grapes Charges Act 1929, by substituting the words " Australian Wine Board " for the words " Wine Overseas Marketing Board " wherever they occur. No new principle is embodied "in the amendment, and I ask honorable members to accept the bill.

### THERAPEUTIC SUBSTANCES BILL 1937

#### Second Reading

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Health &middot; North Sydney &middot; UAP</small>

.- I move- 

  >That the bill be now read a second time. 

The purpose of this bill is to give control over the importation and exportation of that group of medical remedies which are designated in the bill as therapeutic substances. They are to be distinguished from drugs in that they are biological products. Perhaps the two most familiar examples of these substances are diphtheria anti-toxin, which is an example of a substance prepared by bacterial action, and insulin, which is an example of a substance prepared from animal glands. The object of the bill is to ensure that these substances shall be of the right strength and purity, because it is recognized that they are very potent, and would be capable of working great havoc in the community if they were defective in quality. The bill, therefore, proposes to ensure that they shall comply with the following basic requirements :  - 

{: type="a" start="a"}
0. They shall be true to a determined standard, that standard having an official and legal status ; 
1. They shall be free from contamination, more especially from bacterial contamination ; 
2. They must be properly and safely packed; and 
3. They must be accurately labelled as to dosage. 

The standard adopted is that fixed by  the League of Nations. It is international in its acceptation, and is recognized everywhere the League of Nations is recognized. The bill applies only to importations and exportations ; it does not apply to serum anti-toxin and vaccines manufactured at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, which are covered by laws and regulations designed to ensure their absolute purity, and compliance with standard' requirements. 

The bill provides simple machinery giving the Minister power to licence importers so as to give official supervision over the channels of importation, and to supervise the preparation of these substances for export. Every container of these substances must state clearly what it contains, the biological formula for its manufacture, and the standard dose, together with a statement that the contents are free from contamination, and comply with thestandard laid down and recognized. The subject could be amplified at great length, but it is sufficient to say that, in effect, this is a bill which extends that kind of protection which is afforded by the Pure Foods Act to foods, and the Pure Drugs Act to drugs, to those biological preparations which are so extensively used to-day, and upon the purity of which the health and lives of our citizens depend. 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Capricornia</small>

.This bill deals with a subject with which lay members cannot hope to make themselves familiar in the short time at our disposal. The Minister for Health  **(Mr. Hughes)**  was good enough to explain to  *me*  before the House met what the bill was intended to do. He is supported by the advice of the medical officers of his department, men in whom we have the greatest confidence. Therefore, the Opposition can safely support it. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time, and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted. 

Bill -  *by leave*  - read a third time.

This motion does not cover all the re- commendations of the Standing Orders Committee because, as appears in the committee's report, there was a reservation by one member. What that reservation related to I do not know, but I do not think that there can be any difference of opinion regarding the advisability of adopting the new Standing Orders relating to the election of a Speaker and Chairman. 

##### Mr Forde:

--  Was the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee unanimous on that point? 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- The report does not indicate from which part of the proposed new Standing Orders the honorable member for West Sydney  **(Mr. Beasley),**  dissented. 

##### Mr Blackburn:

--  His objection was to certain disciplinary clauses. 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- So I would imagine. The honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn),**  being a member of the committee, is familiar with what transpired. Those clauses, however, are not covered by the motionI have just moved. 

As honorable members will have seen from the report of the committee, the proposed new Standing Orders relating to the election of a Speaker and Chairman are designed to prevent the occurrence of a stalemate by the introduction of a method of voting by ballot in the event of a contest.  I  remember, as also, no doubt, does the honorable member for Bourke, the rather farcical situation that arose in the Parliament of Victoria when it became practically impossible to elect a  Speaker  under the old rule. The difficulty had to be overcome on that occasion by members agreeing to withdraw from the chamber, and to hold a meeting of all parties in order to determine by secret ballot what candidate they would support. The new rules suggested by the committee seem to be admirably fashioned to prevent the occurrence of difficulties of that kind. While they provide for nominations on the floor of the House, and for the election of a  Speaker  and  Chairman  in that way if there is only one candidate for each office, they also provide for the election by ballot in the event of a contest. This allows an immediate result to be achieved, and is more in keeping with the dignity of Parliament. 

##### Mr Beasley:

-- The Attorney-General did not inform us that it was proposed to bring this matter on now. It is most unfair to us. 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- Before the honorable member came into the chamberI was assured that he had not raised any objection to those parts of the proposed new Standing Orders which are covered by the motion now before the House. 

##### Mr Beasley:

--  I am going to take such steps as I can to prevent this matter from being decided now. There is not sufficient time to consider it properly. 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- That being the case, I do not propose to say any more at this stage. 

##### Mr Prowse:

--  I think that we all agreed in the Standing Orders Committee on the first part of the recommendation.

-- I wish to repeat what I have already said to the effect that, in regard to the business of this Parliament, it is customary, if it is not at least a matter of  ordinary courtesy, for the Opposition to be advised of the business the Government proposes to call on. Last week we complained about the long list of bills that was being continually tabled, and were anxious to know just what business the Government proposed to finalize. Subsequently, the Leader of our party informed my colleagues and myself in the party room of what the Government's intentions were, and we proceeded then to adjust our arrangements to meet the business that he indicated. This particular business was not included among the list he gave. 

##### Mr Brennan:

-- Nor does it appear on the notice-paper. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- No reference whatever was made to it in any discussion in the Opposition party room and honorable members on this side heard nothing about it until three or four minutes ago. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- I do not think that is correct; the Deputy Leader was informed about this matter? 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- When? 

Mr.Forde. - The Minister for Commerce  **(Dr. Earle Page)**  this afternoon told me that if there was sufficient time available this business would be brought on, but, I confess, I have not seen this report of the Standing Orders Committee, and, as I am not a member of the committee, I am not aware of its contents. 

##### Mr Holt:

-- The report was circulated. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Hundreds of reports, if not more, are circulated. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; CP; LP from 1944; LCL from 1951; LP from 1954</small>

-- The honorable member is a member of the Standing Orders Committee? 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Yes, and I was interested in the doings of the committee up to the point that I refused to agree to its report being presented to Parliament' without my dissent in respect of certain recommendations being recorded. I took that step with the object of safeguarding my position, because I realized that when the committee's report was submitted to Parliament I would find in it many suggested alterations of which I did not approve. As the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Lyons)**  is now present in the chamber I wish to know if he approves of this business being brought on at this hour. The  Deputy  Leader of the Op position  **(Mr. Forde)**  was notified of this measure only this afternoon, and he has not had time to inform any honorable members on this side of the intentions of the Government. I suggest that it is unfair to ask the House to decide this matter now. In order that I shall have an opportunity to inform myself and my colleagues of the recommendations contained in this report, I shall be obliged to read it over now. I take it that the motion before the House deals with Chapter III., which is headed " Election of  Speaker  and  Chairman  ". That chapter reads - 

{: type="1" start="11"}
0. The election of Speaker shall he conducted in the following manner: - 

    {: type="a" start="a"}
    0. At the opening of Parliament, after the members present have been sworn, or whenever the office of  Speaker  becomes vacant, a Member, addressing himself to the  Clerk,  shall propose some Member, then present, to the House for their  Speaker,  and move that such Member " Do take the Chair of this House as  Speaker  ". which motion shall be seconded. A. Member when proposed and seconded shall inform the House whether he accepts nomination. 


I take it that that is part of the procedure followed at present. Standing Order No. 11 continues - 

{: type="a" start="b"}
0. The  Clerk  shall then ask "Is there any further proposal?", and if, within two minutes thereafter, there is no further proposal, the  Clerk  shall say " The time for proposals has expired "... 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- Is the honorable member reading this for the information of honorable members ? 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Yes, and for  *my*  own information. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- But the honorable member was a member of the committee and went so far as to dissent from its recommendations. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Proposed Standing Order No. 11 continues - 

{: type="i" start="1"}
0. . No Member may then address theHouse or propose any other Member, and the  Clerk  shall, without question put, declarethe Member so proposed and seconded to have been elected as  Speaker,  and such Member shall be conducted to the Chair by his proposer and seconder, and shall take the Chair of the House as  Speaker. 
1. If more than one Member is proposed as  Speaker  the  Clerk  ahull,after the second proposal and after each subsequent proposal (if any) is made and seconded, ask " Is there any further proposal?", and if, within two minutes thereafter, there is no further proposal the  Clerk  shall say, "The time for proposals has expired." 

Up to that point no alteration of existing procedure is proposed but an alteration is proposed in the following paragraph which reads :  - 

{: type="a" start="d"}
0. When the time for proposals has ex pired, debate may ensue, but it shall be relevant to the election. 

Is that alteration being proposed by the Government? 

##### Mr Blackburn:

-- No, by the committee. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Is this being proposed by the Attorney-General? 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- The whole of proposed Standing Order No. 11 has been proposed by me as it has been recommended by the committee. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I want honorable members on this side to note that while I was in the House the Attorney-General made no reference to paragraph  *d*  which I have just read. The right honorable gentleman went on to refer to the position which could arise in the event of more than one member being nominated for the position of  Speaker  and mentioned some difficulty which had occurred in these circumstances in the Victorian Parliament. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- If the honorable member accuses me of not having read that to the House he is right. I assumed that honorable members would have read the report for themselves seeing that it was distributed to them on the 28th June last. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I suggest that the Government has adopted the procedure followed by it in this instance not only for the purpose of securing alterations of the Standing Orders in the absence of certain honorable members, and at a time when certain honorable members have not had an opportunity to peruse the report, but also with the idea of getting away with something really worse. 

##### Mr Lyons:

-- Honorable members have had the report since June. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I say to the Prime Minister that he has had many reports much longer than since June last. If the Prime Minister is to be given credit for what he has said there are many reports which he did not read when they came into his possession. 

##### Mr Lyons:

-- It is no excuse for a member of the committee to say that he has not read the committee's report. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- And it is no excuse for the right honorable gentleman as head of a department to place himself in a position of not having read reports submitted to his department. 


 **Mr. SPEAKER (Hon. G. J. Bell).Order** ! 

##### Mr Lyons:

-- The honorable member is not telling the truth because I am not in charge of the department which he has in mind. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I am referring to the time when the right honorable gentleman was in a cabinet with me. 

##### Mr Lane:

-- Why did you put him out ? 

##### Mr Lyons:

-- He did not put me out. He put out his own leader. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- If you want to be offensive I can be offensive also. 

##### Mr Lyons:

-- Have a go ! 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I can have a go; don't think you can bluff me; you are the last man who can do that. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! I shall not allow these irrelevancies. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I am reminded by the honorable member for Darling.  **(Mr. Clark)**  that the alterations proposed to Standing Order No. 11 raise a very important aspect regarding the exercise of the privilege, right and freedom of honorable members in discussing, on the occasion of the election of  **Mr. Speaker,**  questions which they are ordinarily denied the opportunity to discuss. It has been the custom since this Parliament was established 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; CP; LP from 1944; LCL from 1951; LP from 1954</small>

-- But a bad custom ! 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- That may be the honorable member's opinion, but it is not mine. 

##### Mr Lane:

-- You do not rule Parliament. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I will rule you at the elections with much more effect. 

##### Mr Lane:

-- Like you ruled a municipal council in Glebe the other day ! 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! I shall not allow the debate to be carried on in this way. The honorable member for West Sydney is the only honorable member entitled to be heard. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Ever since this Parliament was established certain provisions have governed discussions on the occasion of the election of  **Mr. Speaker.**  Those provisions gave honorable members an opportunity to offer criticism to men who hold high positions in this country and who, we believe, had, in the period since the election of the previous  Speaker,  taken advantage of their positions to apply decisions and cause injustice to many sections of the community, whereas in the ordinary course of. Parliamentary affairs we were unable to bring such matter*) under notice. Therefore, I shall never cast a vote to allow that privilege to be taken away from honorable members. Irrespective of whether the Standing Orders Committee recommendsit or not I do not agree with proposed paragraph  *d*  of Standing Order No. 11 because I remember the occasion on which this matter was first brought up before the committee.I was not present at subsequent meetings of the committee when it reached its final decision on this matter. When it was first raised before the committee, however, I noted it carefully and intended, when the opportunity arose for its discussion in this Parliament, to do all in my power to see that the committee's recommendation was not adopted. 1" ask my colleagues to take notice of the real change which is being effected by this recommendation. The full import of that change was not suggested, or referred to, by the Attorney-General when he moved that the alteration be made. He just went on to referto something that had happened in the Victorian Parliament - something of which honorable members know nothing, and which has no particular reference to this matter at all. Proposed Standing Order No. 11  *d*  reads - 

  >When the time for proposalshas expired, debate may ensue, hut it shall be relevant to the election. 

This has to be in the hands of the  Clerk  of the House, and he has to determine whether the matter is relevant or not. On the motion for the election of  Speaker,  I have listened to some of the finest speeches that I have heard in this House. 

I well remember a speech of the predecessor of the honorable gentleman who now represents the constituency of Bourke. Consequently, I do not intend to allow that opportunity to be withdrawn from any honorable member. Nor shall I permit this alteration to be sneaked in, in the manner proposed by the AttorneyGeneral to-day. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- On a point of order, I ask whether the honorable member for West Sydney  **(Mr. Beasley)**  is in order in saying that. I am sneaking something in, when, in fact, it has been recommended by a committee which included the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin),**  the honorable member forBourke  **(Mr. Blackburn),**  and the honorable member for Hindmarsh  **(Mr. Makin),**  all of whom concurred in the report ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- That the honorable member is in error does not signify that he is out of order. The honorable member for West Sydney, however, is not in order in saying that the AttorneyGeneral had sneaked anything in. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Ishall state the matter in another form. The impression conveyed by the Attorney-General was that there was nothing contentious in the proposed alteration. He particularly failed to make any reference to this alteration. 

Paragraph  *e*  reads - 

  >No member shall speak for more than five minutes. 

That also is a new proposal. Even in determining the merits or demerits of the candidates who are offering for the position of Speaker, an honorable member will be permitted to speak for not longer than five minutes. Some honorable members may consider that that is sufficient; I do not. Consequently, I shall not agree to such a limitation being imposed. 

Paragraphf reads - 

  >At any time during the debate a motion may bo made by a Minister rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other member is addressing the Chair or not " That the question be now put ". 
  >
  >The  Clerk  shall then put the question, without debate, " That the question be now put ". In the event of the numbers being equal the question shall be decided in the negative. 
  >
  >Upon the carrying of the question" That the question be now put", or upon the cessation of the debate otherwise, the election shall be proceeded with as provided in this Standing Order. 

That again is a new provision. Paragraph  *rj*  reads - 

  >Before the House proceeds' to a ballot the bells shall be rung as in a division. 

Paragraph  *h*  reads - 

  >When only two members are proposed and seconded as  Speaker,  each member shall deliver to the  Clerk  a ballot-paper in writing, containing the name of the candidate for whom he votes; and the candidate who has the greater number of votes shall bc the  Speaker,  and  hu conducted to the Chair. 

In  this  case, the ballot-papers are to be handed to the  Clerk.  It is customary in all ballots for scrutineers to be appointed to check the counting of the votes. No such provision has been made in this Standing Order. These ballot-papers are not to be available to the representatives of the candidates for their perusal, consequently, I do not approve of that change being made. The opportunity should be provided for those who are interested to satisfy themselves that the ballot-papers have not been counted in an irregular manner. Paragraph  *i*  reads - 

  >When more than two members are so proposed and seconded, the votes shall be taken in like manner, and the member \v,ho has the greatest number of votes shall be the  Speaker,  provided he has also a majority of the votes of the members present; but if no candidate has such majority, the name of the candidate having the smallest number of votes shall he excluded from subsequent ballots, and a fresh ballot shall take place; and this shall bc done as often as necessary, until one candidate is declared to be elected as  Speaker  by such majority, when such member shall be conducted to the Chair. 

Paragraph  *j*  deals with an equality of votes.  It reads - 

  >If at any ballot it is impossible by reason of the equality of votes to determine which name shall bc excluded from subsequent ballots, a special ballot shall take place. at which there shall be submitted only the names of those candidates who have received equal votes. At such special ballot each member shall write on his ballot-paper only the name of the candidate ho wishes to retain. The candidate whose name appears upon the smallest number of ballot-papers shall then bc excluded from subsequent ballots. 

I can find no further provision to meet the contingency of an equality of votes again resulting. That is quite likely to happen. The candidates could continue to " go to the post " so long as the votes were properly regimented; and they would be in this House. 

##### Mr Blackburn:

-- Paragraph  *I*  deals with that. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Paragraph  *le*  reads- 

  >At any time after the result of the first ballot is declared, but before the commencement of the second or other subsequent ballot, a candidate may withdraw his name from the election, which shall then proceed as if ho had not been nominated. 

That is followed by paragraph  *I*  which reads - 

  >If by reason of equality of votes a ballot or special ballot is rendered inconclusive, the  Clerk  shall so declare, and unless by a withdrawal another ballot or (as the case may be) another special ballot is rendered unnecessary, hu shall cause such other ballot or special ballot to be taken. If after the counting of votes thu equality continues he shall so declare. Thereupon the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes and when the House re-assembles the votes shall be taken again, unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. 

That does not solve the problem. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- Inquiries will be prosecuted to see if any one will sell his vote. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- The suspension of the sitting for 30 minutes is not what I regard as the proper procedure to adopt on the occasion of the election of a Speaker. What real reason can be advanced for action of that nature? It has be?n suggested that an attempt might be made to buy a couple of votes. 

##### Mr Paterson:

-- That might occur to honorable members opposite. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- The honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron)**  said that 'the honorable gentleman'3 leader was bought. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Tlie party opposite has said that whenever it cared to pay the price it was always able to effect its purpose. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I throw back in the teeth of every honorable member opposite who interjected, the aspersion cast on honorable members on this side of the House. All of them should pay heed to what occurs nearer home. I want to know what reason is advanced for the suspension of the sitting. What is the purpose of the suspension ? If we are assembled here to elect a Speaker, and we proceed by a series of ballots to accomplish that purpose, what need is there for the suspension of the sitting? 

##### Mr Prowse:

-- What does the honorable member suggest as an alternative? 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I cannot see the need for the suspension of the sitting, and I want to know why it should he suspended. After all, the same men will return to this chamber and the same question will have to be decided by them. 

##### Mr Prowse:

-- The electors change their minds in a period of three years; we might change ours in a period of 30 minutes. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I am aware that many honorable members speak in one way and vote in another; that is not uncommon. The honorable member for Forrest  **(Mr. Prowse)**  may regard that as a reason, but I consider that it is not one which should carry much weight. 

##### Mr Prowse:

-- I did not intend to offer offence. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I am not regarding the honorable member's statement in that light. At the same time, the public would regard the proceedings as strange if the sitting were suspended to enable a determination to be reached in connexion with the most important position that this House has to fill. I want to know what reasons are advanced for the suspension of the sitting for 30 minutes. The proposed Standing Order provides that when the House re-assembles the votes shall be taken again, unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. That does not place the position in a very favorable light. I am certain that if a candidate for election as  Speaker  returned to the chamber after the sitting had been suspended for 30 minutes, and withdrew his nomination, a certain degree of suspicion would attach to his withdrawal. Paragraph  *m*  reads - 

  >Whenever at any stage a withdrawal leaves only one candidate remaining, he shall without further voting, be declared elected as  Speaker,  and shall then be conducted to the Chair. 

I should have thought that the next paragraph would have provided, in the case of continued equality of votes, for a further suspension of the sitting for 30 minutes, but there is no such provision. Therefore, it could happen, as the result of the adoption of this suggested new procedure, that equality of votes would continue. After all the procedure contained in this recommendation, with 'the suspension of the sitting thrown in, it is quite possible and competent for honorable members to be just as equally divided in their votes after the resumption of the sitting as they were before it. What would happen then? Apparently there is no answer to that question. 

##### Mr Nairn:

-- Either we must have the  Clerk  give a casting vote or decide the matter by lot. Has the honorable member any better alternative? 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- There is no provision for either of those courses in the proposed new standing order. I was prepared to allow matters to remain as they are. If we are to have the  Clerk  giving a casting vote or drawing lots, why is it not stated? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; CP; LP from 1944; LCL from 1951; LP from 1954</small>

-- The  Clerk  cannot give a casting vote. He is not a member of the House. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- This proposed new standing order provides for the  Clerk  to count the votes and do a series of things connected with the election of the  Speaker.  It could equally provide for a casting vote to be given by the  Clerk. 

##### Mr Nairn:

-- Is it not preferable for the House to' decide? 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- What will happen if the House cannot decide? What will happen if equality of votes continues to prevail after all the procedure listed has been completed ? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; CP; LP from 1944; LCL from 1951; LP from 1954</small>

-- Any one would imagine from the honorable member's remarks that after the elections each side will be returned with 37 members. 

##### Mr Brennan:

-- Why is this controversial matter thrust upon us now? 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- That is the point ! 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- It only became controversial half an hour ago. 

##### Mr Brennan:

-- Nonsense ! 

##### Mr SPEAKER - Honorable members must cease:


 **Mr. SPEAKER.-** Honorable members must cease interjecting. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- It is clear that, under this proposed procedure, a situation could arise in which equality of votes would continue, and that there could be a deadlock in the election of the  Speaker.  It is not clear how the election of the  Speaker  could be brought to the point of conclusion under any of the suggestions that have been made. 

The suggested new standing order provides, further - 

{: type="a" start="n"}
0. Having been conducted to the chair, the member elected returns his acknowledgments to the House for the honour conferred upon him-- 

##### Mr Brennan:

--  If he cares to do so. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Yes, if he cares to do so. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; CP; LP from 1944; LCL from 1951; LP from 1954</small>

--  Does the honorable member object to that? 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I do not know whether it is very necessary. It makes no difference. Why waste time? The recommendation continues -  and thereupon sits down in the chair, and then the mace (which before lay under the table) shall be laid upon the table. 

I remind the House that, whereas there is to be a time limit on speeches made prior to the election of the  Speaker,  no provision is made in this proposal for a time limit on speeches congratulating the new  Speaker  on his election to the Chair. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; CP; LP from 1944; LCL from 1951; LP from 1954</small>

--  The new Speaker would put a time limit to the congratulatory speeches. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- What would happen if he did not? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; CP; LP from 1944; LCL from 1951; LP from 1954</small>

--  We would get a new Speaker. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- Oh ! The honorable member might, but other honorable members might not be in the same frame of mind. Only five minutes is permitted to discuss the merits of the candidates offering. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; CP; LP from 1944; LCL from 1951; LP from 1954</small>

--  That is enough. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I am sure it would take the honorable member much longer-- 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; CP; LP from 1944; LCL from 1951; LP from 1954</small>

--  I could reckon the honorable member up in half a minute. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I would not require even that time to reckon up the honorable member for Barker because long ago I reckoned him up. The recommendation continues - 

  >The  Speaker  having been congratulated, a Minister shall inform the House at what time the Governor-General will be pleased to receive the House for the purpose of presenting the  Speaker  to  His Excellency,  and the sitting of the House shall then be suspended until that time. 
  >
  >Before proceeding to any business, the  Speaker,  with the House, shall present himself to the Governor-General; and, on returning, shall pass through the chamber, and, having resumed the chair, shall report his presentation to the Governor-General. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member's time has expired. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Gander)**  put - 

  >That the honorable member have leave to continue his speech. 

The House divided. (Mr. Speaker - Hon. G. J. Bell.)

AYES: 18

NOES: 28

Question so resolved in the negative. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

.- The whole of the draft Standing Orders was the work of a committee which represented all parties in this House and included three party leaders, two former Speakers, the honorable member for Hindmarsh  **(Mr. Makin),**  and our late lamented friend,  **Sir Littleton**  Groom, the honorable member for West Sydney  **(Mr. Beasley),**  who was a leader, and myself. I think I was appointed because of some experience I have had in the matter of Standing Orders. The Standing Orders were considered very elaborately at a great number of meetings and the one now before the House gave the committee considerable trouble. In my opinion, as proposed, it is a very good standing order, and one that the House should adopt. So strongly did I feel on this point that I went, as I believe others did, to the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Lyons)**  and asked that he should bring the matter before the House before it rose. This will be the last meeting of this Parliament and, if the Standing Order is to be of any value in the election of the new  Speaker  in the next Parliament, it is necessary that it should be passed now. I am not able to speak for the honorable member for Hindmarsh or for the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin),**  who are absent, but I believe that I was not the only member of the Standing Orders Committee from this side of the House who approached the Prime Minister upon this matter. The House realizes of course, that we have had no complete revision of the Standing Orders since first we provisionally adopted Standing Orders in 1903. All attempts at a complete revision have been fruitless. It is realized - I realize at any rate - that the whole of the proposed new Standing Orders are not likely to be speedily passed by this Parliament, but I do think, from my own experience in this House and elsewhere, that it would be excellent to adopt this Standing Order, which provides for the election of the  Speaker.  I regret that it has come to us late, but I understand the matter was mentioned last week. I was told this morning by a member of my own party that this business would come on to-day. 

##### Mr Beasley:

--  How did the honorable member know it would come on to-day? 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- I was not here last night, but I was told by a member of my own party that it would come on to-day. 

##### Mr Brennan:

--  I was not told. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- The position at present is that the  Speaker  is elected by a House of  74  members. He is elected with the  Clerk  in the chair who is not a member of the House and has no casting vote. It is perfectly possible for a tie to result. In the opinion of the committee, the best possible means of settling that issue' is that now proposed. Only the 


 **Speaker** has a casting vote under our Constitution. The situation foreseen by the honorable member for West Sydney  **(Mr. Beasley)**  might arise in an open election in. the House. 

When this subject was under the consideration of the committee two defects in the present system were . apparent - a major and a minor defect. The major defect is that the  Speaker  is a government nominee. The choice of the Government becomes the choice of the House, and the  Speaker  is chosen on a party division. If a secret ballot were necessary, the  Speaker  would become, in a very real sense, the choice of the House.  The minor difficulty is that the officer in charge of the proceedings at the election of the  Speaker,  being an officer of the House, is not a member of the Parliament, and is not, in the nature of things, entitled to demand from honorable members the same respect as would be required by a presiding officer who is the choice of the House. In this Parliament, and also in another Parliament, I have seen the  Clerk  of the House put in a most unfortunate position in connexion with the election of  Speaker.  The former  Clerk  of this House was put in the unhappy position of having to accept a motion that an honorable member be no longer heard. 

The proposal now submitted by the Standing Orders Committee would obviate both ' difficulties. A secret ballot would ensure that the choice of the presiding officer would really be the choice of the House. The  Clerk  of the House could not, of course, be given a casting vote. No provision is made in the Constitution for _ such a situation ; nor is there any pro.vision for  lot3  to be drawn. The Standing Orders Committee was of the opinion that, in the event of a position of equality persisting after the second ballot honorable members should be given an opportunity to think about the subject before a further ballot was taken, and in a different atmosphere. It was for that reason that the suspension of the sitting was recommended. 

The honorable member for West Sydney should realize that both the honorable member for Hindmarsh, a member of his own party, and an ex-Speaker of the House, and the  late honorable, member for Darling Downs,  **Sir Littleton**  Groom, also an exSpeaker, approved of this proposal. I believe that all honorable gentlemen would approve of it if they would approach it dispassionately and on its merits. Unless 'this proposal i3 adopted now wc shall probably find ourselves at the inception of the sitting of the next. Parliament in a similar position to that which faced us at the inception of the sitting of this Parliament. I suggest, with respect, as a comparative tyro in the House, that such a situation does not become the dignity of the House; nor does * it tend to increase the esteem in which Parliament is held by the people. It is not calculated, either, to cause the public, or even honorable members, to believe that the  Speaker  is actually selected for his personal capacity, and not merely because he is a government nominee. I arn sure that any  Speaker  would be happy to feel that he had been really selected by the members of the House, and was not beholden in any way for his position to the party in power, in which case, a weak man might show a tendency to lean, towards the Government party. We have had ample evidence, of course, that you, sir, have discharged the duties of your high office with absolute impartiality and very high ability indeed. I have felt pleased and proud to sit under your chairmanship in this House. A weaker man might  *have*  felt obligations to the Government, and might have been disposed to defer to the wishes of the Government, with the result that government supporters might have enjoyed privileges not accorded to honorable members of the Opposition. We should avoid any situation of that description. 

The object of the Standing Orders Committee was to provide, within the limits of the Constitution, for such a'persistent e.ase of equality as might easily arise with this Parliament constituted as it, is at present, for 37 honorable members might vote on either side. 'In such a case, the only possible means of reaching a decision would be by the common sense of honorable members. I, myself, favour a. secret ballot for the election of Speaker for the same reason that I favour a secret ballot for the election of candidates for  Parlia-  ment, so that a man may, without fear, favour, or affection, feel free to cast his vote for the best man available. The merit of the. proposal now before the House is that it achieves that end. 

This is an urgent matter. If .this proposal is adopted now it will- enable the new procedure to be applied at the opening of the new parliament. I am sorry that suggestions of bad faith have been made in this matter. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- I am sorry that the honorable member approached the Government before he approached his own  party 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- I informed the Leader of my party and he approved of my having approached the Prime Minister. 

##### Mr Lyons:

-- I also informed the Leader of the Opposition that I had spoken to the honorable member for Bourke. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- I had not the slightest idea that any member of the Standing Orders Committee was opposed to this proposal. The honorable member for West Sydney  **(Mr. Beasley)**  made a reservation at the last meeting of the committee when he objected to certain proposed disciplinary measures. I did not know that there was any objection to this proposal for the election of  Speaker.  Had I known of it I should not have made my suggestion to the Prime Minister. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Holt)**  negatived - 

  >That the question be now put. 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Capricornia</small>

.- I urge the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Lyons)**  to agree to the postponement of the consideration of this subject. Just before the House met the Minister for Commerce  **(Dr. Earle Page)**  spoke to me about the business proposed to be submitted to honorable members. He said that two or three small measures would be 'brought up. I asked him if any other business was to be submitted and he said "If we have time we shall probably consider the unanimous report from the Standing Orders Committee covering the recommendations for the election of  Speaker  and so on; but there is nothing contentious in it because there unanimity  in the committee 

##### Mr Beasley:

--  The right honorable gentleman misled the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- The bills referred to by the Minister were introduced and, with the assistance of the Opposition, were speedily passed. 1 am not a member of the Standing Orders Committee and I confess that I have not read the rather voluminous report which I understand was distributed to honorable members some time ago. 1 should like to know how many honorable members find time to read all the reports put into their boxes. Sometimes halfadozen reports are submitted in one day. As the Standing Orders Committee was not unanimous on this point I urge that honorable members be given an opportunity to debate the question. It would not be wise for the Prime Minister to rush this business through in the dying hours of the Parliament. Had this business been put on the notice-paper for a particular time, honorable members would have had an opportunity to consider it and might have been prepared to diffusa it. At any rate they would have had a. chance to peruse the report. Further, the report could have been considered at special meetings of the parties. Honorable members might suggest that this is not a subject for party consideration, but surely the provisions of the Standing Orders are of vital consequence not only to members of the Labour party but also to the members of other parties in the House. I urge the Prime Minister to agree to the postponement of the consideration of this report which, I find, contains 41 printed pages. I doubt whether it has been read by more than three or four members of the House, and it should not he expected that the House would accept it without comment' in the dying hours of the Parliament. I am as industrious as any other member of the House, and I have not had time to read the report. There is just cause for asking the Prime Minister to agree to a postponement, of the consideration of the report until such time as honorable members have had adequate opportunity to consider it. 

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Wilmot &middot; UAP</small>

1  4.2S]. - The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Forde)**  has appealed to me 10 agree to the postponement of the consideration of this report on only one ground, which is that the Minister for Commerce  **(Dr. Earle Page),**  who had discussed the subject with him, suggested that the- recommendations contained in it had the unanimous support of the members of the Standing Orders Committee. lt now appears that absolute unanimity was not reached in the committee. Of its eight members seven approved of these proposals, and one disapproved of 1 hem 

##### Mr Brennan:

--  That is an important consideration. 

##### Mr LYONS:

-- The honorable member who disapproved of the proposals attended, so I am informed, only two meetings of the committee. 

##### Mr Brennan:

--  This, is petty. 

##### Mr LYONS:

-- lt would be impossible to achieve any greater' degree of unanimity, apart from perfect unanimity, than that which has been achieved. Now that tlie honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  has spoken, I am free to refer to this matter. He approached me because lie realized how stupid Parliament might be made to appear iu the eyes of the people of Australia. 

##### Mr Beasley:

--  Did he say that? 

##### Mr LYONS:

-- No. but he must have realized it as the result of what occurred on the last occasion when a  Speaker  was elected. In order, therefore, that such an occurrence might be avoided in the future, and being desirous of maintaining the dignity of Parliament he, as a former  Speaker  of the Parliament of Victoria, recommended that some better system be introduced. This had nothing whatever to do with the party. He suggested that if the House could not pass all the recommendations of the committee, it might at least make provision for the election of a  Speaker  for the next Parliament on proper and 'dignified lines. I accepted that suggestion, I discussed it with my colleagues, and mentioned it to the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin),**  who is now absent. I want to be fair. to him: he did not commit himself to any particular line of action. 

##### Mr Beasley:

-- He wanted to discuss it with his party, of course. 

##### Mr LYONS:

-- Which party? We now bring this motion forward, having done everything we could be expected to do, and realizing the necessity for doing something before the next Parliament is elected. I see no reason for postponing a decision by this Parliament to ensure proper, orderly and dignified proceedings for the election of a Speaker.

### ADJOURNMENT

British Air Mail Service and Qantas Agreements - Valedictory - Broom Millet - Assistance to Local Governing Bodies - Motor-body Building - Radio Messages to Shipping - Oil Search File. 

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Wilmot &middot; UAP</small>

.- I move- 

  >That the House do now adjourn. 

The negotiations regarding the British air mail service and Qantas agreements have been proceeded with but, as is usual where negotiations have to be conducted by telegram, there have been delays. For these delays the Commonwealth has not been responsible. Both agreements are nearing the final stage, outstanding matters having been reduced to comparatively minor details. They will be submitted to Parliament at the first opportunity after their completion. 

We have now reached the end of the proceedings of the present Parliament. I take this opportunity to offer to you first,  **Mr. Speaker,**  my deep thanks for and my appreciation of the manner in which you have presided over our deliberations during the last three years. To-day a very high compliment was paid to you bythe honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn),**  who in another sphere occupied the position that you occupy in this sphere, when he said that it was an honour and a privilege to him to sit and serve under you. You have brought to the discharge of your duties not only ability but also impartiality. The recent disagreement between you and me emphasized the impartiality of your decisions. You have not recognized party, but have done your utmost to uphold the dignity of this Parliament. Therefore, I am confident that I speak on behalf of all honorable members when I thank you very sincerely for all that you have done. Whatever limitations may be imposed upon my later remarks, both personal and political, I am in a position to wish you, at any rate, well. 

The. sentiments that I have expressed in regard to you, I extend also to the  Chairman  of Committees  **(Mr. Prowse).** 

We all owe a deep debt of gratitude to the officers of Parliament for the assistance that they have rendered to us. The 

Clerk of the House was recently promoted to that position. On behalf of members generally, I express appreciation of  his  ability and impartiality, and thank him for his assistance. I have been associated with the present Clerk of the House throughout my political' career whether in the State or in the Commonwealth Parliament. I was associated with him back in the days when he was Clerk Assistant in the smaller Tasmanian Parliament, and during all these years his work has been marked by efficiency and impartiality. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his recent appointment and to wish him long years of success. To those associated with him and to all other members of the staff of this House, whether their spheres of duty are inside or outside the chamber, I offer my thanks and appreciation. Politicians are very much indebted to them for the assistance that they give. Furthermore, I may be permitted to say at this juncture, because as we approach the general elections the close of these proceedings is different from the normal conclusion of sittings, that I extend my thanks to the whole of the Public Service of the Commonwealth of Australia. 

When the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin)**  was leaving this Parliament a week ago to embark upon the election campaign, I expressed my sentiments towards him. We all have the greatest respect for the Leader of the Opposition. Although he is a political opponent, we regard him as being a personal friend, and wish him well personally, although not politically. 

This has been a strenuous Parliament. We have had to face difficult problems and, at times, party political feeling has run fairly high, but at the close of it we are in a position to say that whatever views we have of the politics of, our opponents, we have a high personal regard for them. Therefore,  **Mr. Speaker,**  at the close of this Parliament, I want to thank all, you  **Mr. Speaker,**  the  Chairman  of Committees, officials, members of the Opposition and, particularly, the officers of  *Hansard,*  who, with great efficiency, embellish and polish our speeches so that they look worth while for us to present in our constituencies. I pay that particular tribute to the  *Ilansard*  staff because they have been of very great help to honorable members. 

##### Mr Gander:

-- What about the Whips? 

##### Mr LYONS:

-- The Whips have been wonderful, each to his own particular party. As far as I know there has been nothing more efficient than the mathematical performances of the Whips, because, in divisions, they have been able to count and add up correctly. Therefore, to the Whips 1 offer thanks on behalf of the Government and honorable members on this side. I have no more to say except to express the hope that just as the electors are represented in this Parliament at this moment, they will again be represented after the elections. 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Capricornia</small>

.- In the unavoidable absence of the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin)**  I wish to express the appreciation of the Opposition at the very fair and impartial manner in which you,  **Mr. Speaker,**  have carried out your duties to this House. The success of parliamentary institutions depends on the conduct of the business in Parliament, and that in turn depends to a great extent on the personal attributes of the presiding officers. We realize, as an Opposition, that your position is onerous and that your duties at times are irksome. When feeling runs high in debate it is often extremely difficult to maintain order, but we believe, as an Opposition, that you have always endeavoured, to the very best of your ability, to act impartially. You have done credit to yourself and to the exalted position which you occupy. 

Although the  Chairman  of Committees and I disagree violently on tariff questions, I am glad to say he has done his work as  chairman  ably and well, and has endeavoured to sec members of the Opposition- as frequently as members on the Government side of the House. 

It would be extremely difficult for you,  **Mr. Speaker,**  and for the  Chairman  of Committees, to discharge your duties in Parliament without the able services of the  Clerk  of the Parliament, the Assistant Clerks, the Serjeant-at-Arms, and other members of the staff. In paying tribute to the ability of the present  Clerk  I extend to him our very hearty congratulations upon the attainment of his high position. I also wish to offer a meed of praise to his predecessor in office,  **Mr. Parkes,**  who, having reached the retiring age during the life of this Parliament, has laid down his duties. We were all deeply indebted to him for his assistance in our work. The smooth-running of the machinery of Parliament depends to a. great extent on the courtesy, ability and efficiency of the Clerks. 

##### Mr Brennan:

-- It would be interesting to know what they think of us at times. 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- It would be intensely interesting. I also extend our hearty congratulations to the members of the  *Hansard*  staff. It is really remarkable that in all the confusion that sometimes occurs in Parliament, with cross-firing and interjections, they are able to compile such intelligent reports of our speeches for us to read the next day. We are particularly fortunate in this Parliament, also, in having such a courteous and capable staff of attendants. Frequently four or five signals must appear at a time in the attendants' alcove, and I have been amazed at the speed, accuracy and unfailing courtesy of the attendants in replying to the calls made upon them. They seem to be able to produce, with the utmost promptness, anything that honorable members may desire, except suitable missiles to cast at an opponent. 

We are indebted to the staff of the Parliamentary Library.  **Mr. Binns**  and his capable assistants render invaluable service to honorable members by their researches, and their ability to provide us with information for the preparation of our speeches. 

Although in the heat of debate feeling runs high at times between honorable members on one side of the House and those on the other, and although we, as an Opposition, strongly oppose Government supporters on certain matters of policy, we leave this Parliament without carrying away with us any personal animosities. The Labour party faces the elections with a feeling of confidence. We hope that when. Parliament re-assembles we shall be sitting on the other side of the House and honorable gentlemen opposite will be on this side of it, in which event we trust they will be able to extend the co-operation that is expected  of a reasonable opposition in order to assist an enlightened government to put its proposed legislation on the statute book. 

##### Dr EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Commerce &middot; Cowper &middot; CP</small>

--  I promised the honorable member for Echuca  **(Mr. McEwen)**  some time ago that I would obtain for him information regarding the recent conference of millet-growers. A meeting representative of broom millet growers in New South Wales, Victoria and 'Queensland, the broom manufacturers in New South Wales, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce, was held at the office of the Department of Commerce "in Sydney, to-day. Questions affecting the disposal of existing stocks, and proposals for dealing with future el'ops, were discussed. Arising out of the discussion it was resolved that an Australian Broom Millet Advisory Committee, consisting of not more chan two growers, and not more than two manufacturers from each State, should be formed, with an independent  chairman  nominated by the Department of Commerce. The purpose of the committee will be immediately to gather all available information regarding present stocks and crop prospects for the coming season. It will then meet again with the object of determining reasonable prices for millet, having regard to the estimated quantity available, manufacturers' requirements and market prospects. Some concern was expressed by delegates regarding the possibility of a surplus of broom millet being carried over into 193S. It was therefore decided that ali available information about the present position and future prospects .should be circulated by the Department of Commerce to growers' organizations as soon as possible for the guidance of growers in planning their sowing programme for the coming season. 

I desire to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Lyons)**  and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Forde)**  who congratulated you,  **Mr. Speaker,**  and the  Chairman  of Committees, upon the manner in which you have carried out your duties. I also desire to express my appreciation and thanks to the officers of the House, to the  *Hansard*  staff, to the attendants and all those associated .with the conduct of Parliament, for the assistance they have rendered during the session. I also desire to thank honorable members in all parts of the House for their assistance. 

##### Mr CASEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; Corio &middot; UAP</small>

-- Yesterday the honorable member for Echuca  **(Mr. McEwen)**  asked for particulars regarding the operation of the act in which £100,000 was voted for interest and sinking f-nd in connexion with funds made available to local bodies for public works. Honorable members will recall that the Commonwealth Government was anxious to assist in making provision for the unemployed in the States. There were two methods, and only two, by which this could be done. One was a grant to tlie States from revenue, and the other was to allocate loan moneys to the States. It soon became apparent that both methods were becoming increasingly difficult, because the Commonwealth Government did not have any appreciable amount of surplus revenue from which to make grants, and the making of loan moneys available was a dubious advantage, because all loan moneys come out of the same pool, and the more loan moneys made available by the Commonwealth, the less is available for the States. A scheme was therefore devised under which the Commonwealth Government set aside from revenue £100.000 a year for ten years, for use by local bodies in the States on condition that the States set aside a similar amount. This scheme, under which £200,000 a year was made available, came into operation a year ago, and has proved, in practice, very satisfactory. The value of the works thus assisted amounts to £9,250,000. The money was distributed strictly on a population basis, and the States, almost without exception, have acted up to the spirit and letter of the Commonwealth Government's intention. As a complete list of the works approved, most of which have already been set in motion by the various States, would be too long to insert in  *Hansard.*  I have arranged to place fifty or sixty copies of the list on the table of the library, where they may be perused by honorable members. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

.- I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs  **(Mr. White)**  a complaint by members of the Coachmakers Federation that motor bodies which were formerly made in Australia are now being imported in the form of panels which have only to be assembled. It is claimed by the union that this practice has deprived some of its members of employment and threatens the employment of a great many others. I have been asked to bring this state of affairs to the notice of the Minister, and I now ask him to investigate it. 

##### Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Defence &middot; Warringah &middot; UAP</small>

-- The honorable member for Boothby  **(Mr. Price)**  asked to-day what progress was being made in the direction of remedying the disparity between the Australian charges with respect to radiogrammes exchanged with British ships, and those which apply in the case of British coastal stations. I am advised' that the Postmaster-General's Department has been dealing with this matter, but difficulty is being experienced in getting into line other interests concerned. Every endeavour is being made to bring the matter to finality. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">West Sydney</small>

-- About three quarters of an hour ago I received a file which the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Lyons)**  promised would be made available to me. It deals with the search for oil in New Guinea, and the reports obtained from the Administrator of the Mandated Territory. The file is a bulky one, and as it will be impossible for me to complete my examination of it before the train departs to-night, I should be glad if the Prime Minister would agree to my taking a portion of it away with me, so that I might finish my investigation. The facts which I have already gleaned are most informative and important, and will be of great interest to the public. 

##### Mr WHITE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; Balaclava &middot; UAP</small>

--  I noticed in the press a statement by one of the trade unions that motor bodies had been admitted in a knocked down condition, ready for assembly, but I have had no official complaint. The records show that strong pressure is being exercised to allow panels from which steel bodies are built to be admitted under by-law, but this request has been resisted up to the present time, although the agents for some of the smaller motor cars claim that the poundage basis on which panels are admitted makes them too expensive if assembled in Australia. If the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  has information which shows that Australian workmen are being deprived of employment, I shall have the matter investigated, and I shall inform him of the position later by letter, but I doubt whether there has been any loss of employment because the number of employees now engaged in the industry is over 12,000 and is increasing. 

##### Mr LYONS:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Wilmot &middot; UAP</small>

--  *in reply*  - A few moments ago, I referred to the various branches of the Parliamentary staff to whom the thanks of honorable members are due for their assistance, but I overlooked one very important section of workers in this building, to which, we owe a great deal. I desire to add an expression of my appreciation of the services rendered by the members of the press gallery. These gentlemen have become, through the years, the personal friends of all of us. They render a great service to the community by the faithful reports which they supply of the proceedings of this Parliament. I am sure that members of the Opposition join in this expression of appreciation. 

To-day I offered to allow the honorable member for West Sydney  **(Mr. Beasley)**  access to the file relating to the search for oil in Dutch New Guinea and in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. I am afraid, however, that I cannot accede to his request that I should allow the whole or any portion of the file to leave Canberra, because, so far as I know, no precedent exists for such a course. The -honorable member may take advantage of any opportunity available to him to peruse the file in Canberra; but I think that he, having had ministerial experience, will agree that it would be improper for me to do as he suggests. The general practice is to table such documents either in. the House or in the Parliamentary Library, where they are available to honorable members and also the press. But this file was made available only to the honorable member. 


 **Mr. SPEAKER** (Hon. G. J. Bell).Before  putting the motion I wish to thank the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Lyons)**  and the Acting Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Forde)**  for their expressions of appreciation of my services in the chair ; I hope that I deserve all that they have said of me. The  Chairman  of Committees and the Temporary Chairmen of Committees will, I know, allow me to acknowledge, on their behalf, the praise that has been bestowed on their work. I am grateful for the courtesy that has been extended to me by Ministers and by honorable members generally, and the assistance they have rendered me in carrying out my duties. Without their co-operation I could not have discharged those duties satisfactorily. I have done my best, but I would not be human had I always been right, and honorable members would not be human had they thought that I was always right. If I have given satisfaction to Ministers and to honorable members, I, too, am satisfied. The officers of the House and the members of the various staffs have carried out their duties with exceptional ability, and I thank them for their uniform courtesy and helpfulness. While in the chair I have known no politics; but within the next" few weeks my interest in party politics will be revived. All of us may not be here when the House reassembles, but whether we are or not, I wish well to all honorable members. I shall always feel proud of having had the privilege of presiding over the deliberations of this chamber. 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

House adjourned at 6.35 p.m.
