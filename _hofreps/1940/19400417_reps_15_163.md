### DEATH OF THE HONORABLE W. H. WILKS

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Kooyong &middot; UAP</small>

-- It is with regret that I inform honorable members that the Honorable William Henry : Wilks, a former member of this chamber, died in Melbourne on the 5th February last. 


 **Mr. Wilks** enjoyed the distinction of being a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament. He was elected to represent the Division of Dalley in 1901, and held that seat until the general elections of 1910, When he was defeated. Prior to entering the Commonwealth Parliament, he had been a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales for a period of seven years, so that in total he had a very long and an extremely useful public career.  His  Commonwealth parliamentary service included the occupancy of the position of Government Whip in 1904-5, of Chairmanship of Committees in 1905-7, and of Chairmanship on the Royal Commission oh Postal Services in 1908. 

Many years have passed since the late  **Mr. Wilks**  held a seat in this Parliament ; therefore, he may be personally unknown to a large number of honorable members. I, of course, did not know him in his capacity as a member of this Parliament, but I had the advantage of some personal acquaintance with him a number of years ago, and I am quite sure that I speak on behalf of all honorable members when I say that very great regret will be felt on both sides of the House at the passing of a man who, for a long period of years, rendered noted service to the State of New South Wales in the Parliament of that State and te the people of Australia in this Commonwealth Parliament. I recall a remark made by the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin)**  on the occasion of a similar motion last year, when he drew attention to the very special place that was occupied in the parliamentary history of Australia by those who were members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. They were, so to speak, pioneers of the parliamentary institution of the Commonwealth at that time - a. new Commonwealth, with a form that was little understood, and a future that was necessarily hidden. We have great reason to be grateful to the men who worked in this Parliament in its early and formative years. Accordingly, I am quite sure that there will be special regret at the passing of yet one more of those men who held membership of the first Commonwealth Parliament. I desire, on behalf of the Government and of Parliament, to extend our very deep sympathy to the widow and family of the late  **Mr. Wilks**  in their bereavement. I move - 

  >Unit this House records its sincere regret at the death of the Honorable William Henry Wilks, a former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Dalley and a member of the First Commonwealth Parliament, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Leader of the Opposition &middot; Fremantle</small>

-- I beg to second the motion. Like the right honorable the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Menzies),**  I had no personal association with the late  **Mr. Wilks;**  but all of us in this place are sufficiently well informed regarding the history of the federation to know that a man who, in the first decade of its existence, shared the tremendously difficult task of piloting this Commonwealth through its infant years, was one who not only had a great and an exceedingly important trusteeship for the future of Australia, but also, by reason of his previous membership of the Parliament of New South Wales, and his successive re-elections to this Parliament, must have won a very high place in the. regard of his contemporaries, lt is, I believe, true, that all of the members of the First Commonwealth Parliament, apart from the privilege that they had of being the first members of this National Parliament, were in themselves men of very great capacity. Most of them had served in the Parliaments of the States, and some of them will, I think, remain for all time imperishable figures in our national history. Although every member of the Parliament could not occupy a place in the Government, I think that it must be true that there was a large number of them who were none the less of very great value to the public life and the public service of the day. So far as my reading enables me to form an opinion, I should say that the late  **Mr. Wilks**  was far from being the least of those men. Even to be the humblest in such a distinguished gallery was indeed to be a very important figure. I pay tribute to the late honorable gentleman's work, and on behalf of my colleagues and myself offer sympathy to his bereaved family. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Commerce &middot; BarkerMinister for Commerce &middot; CP</small>

-- I desire to associate the Country party with all that has been said concerning the late  **Mr. Wilks,**  and on behalf of that party extend sympathy to those who have been bereaved. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:<br><small class="text-muted">Dalley</small>

-- I associate myself with the very kindly remarks that have already been made in memory of the late honorable member for Dalley.' As lias been indicated, the late  **Mr. Wilks**  was one of the pioneers on the unblazed track of Federal government, and played a very important part in the early work of this Parliament. He was a man of considerable political courage, and although his particular shade of politics was not entirely in harmony with that of the electorate that he represented, nevertheless, for nine years, he served faithfully the party to which he belonged in a division which has since transferred its political allegiance to another political party. He played a prominent part in the affairs of both the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth, and was always a fearless fighter on behalf of those whom he held dear. By reason of my very early recollections of the political struggle in this particular electorate, I can say of him that, whatever his views were, he placed them fearlessly before the people and was at all times a fair fighter in the interests of those whom he represented. It is to his credit, too, that although he has been dissociated fromthe work of this Parliament for many years, he continued to retain an interest in the politics of this country. The opinions that he expressed to political friends as well as to political opponents were valuable, because of the wide experience he had had in politics. I desire to associate his old friends, as well as his old political opponents in my electorate - who speak well of him - with the remarks that have been made, and on behalf of the present generation in that electorate, convey very sincere sympathy to his relatives, as well as to the country in general, in the loss of one of its most prominent citizens. 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Attorney-General &middot; North Sydney AttorneyGeneral &middot; UAP</small>

-- I desire to associate myself with the remarks made by the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Menzies)**  and those who have also spoken on this motion. I knew  **Mr. Wilks**  very well. He and I were close personal friends. We entered the Parliament of New South Wales at the same time and remained together in that legislature until the establishment of the Commonwealth, when we were both returned to this Parliament. I knew him intimately. He was a bright spirit. We were not members of the same party, but he was a man of democratic instincts. He served his country well. He was an upright and honorable man, and one in whose friendship I rejoiced. I deeply regret his death. 

Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Menzies)**  agreed  to - 

  >That  **Mr. Speaker**  be requested to  transmit to  **Mrs. Wilks**  the  foregoing resolution,  together with a  copy  of  the speeches delivered thereon.

#### APPLES AND PEARS

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">FRANKLIN, TASMANIA</small>

-- Has the attention of the Minister for Commerce been drawn to a. report in the Sydney  *Daily Telegraph*  in reference to the conveyance of fruit from the wharves to the Sydney market? The statement reads - 

  >Delivery of thousands of cases of apples and pears was held up yesterday morning while members of the Master Fruit Carriers' Association conferred with the Apple and Fear Board. 
  >
  >The carriers complained about the carting arrangements controlled by the board. " Conditions have been chaotic ever since the Apple and Pear Acquisition Scheme was introduced," said the secretary of the Master Fruit Carriers' Association  **(Mr. J. V. Sheridan ) yesterday. " One of our members waited on Monday from 7 a.m. till 3 p.m. expecting to cart 1,800 cases of apples to an agent." "After that long wait all he got was 78 cases."** 

Will the Minister have an investigation made of the delivery from the Sydney wharves of fruit acquired by the Commonwealth Government, as the Apple and Pear Board in New South Wales seems to be trying to make a failure of the marketing scheme, thus causing heavy loss to the growers? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

-- I have not seen the paragraph but I shall look at it and let the honorable gentleman know what the position is. 

##### Mr JOHN LAWSON:<br><small class="text-muted">MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-- Is the Minister for Commerce in a position to say what payment has been made under the apple and pear acquisition scheme in respect of each case of fruit? Will he explain the basis upon which future payments will be made, and state whether or not it is a fact, as reported, that it is not intended to make any further payment in respect of apples and pears until after August of this year? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- The first payment was1s. 4d. a case in respect of three-quarters of the assessed crop of each grower. A second payment of8d. a. case in respect of apples, and an additional1s. a case in respect of pears, has been authorized. Another payment of1s. a case in respect of approved qualities delivered to the board's agents will be made on delivery of the fruit. As to the third part of the honorable member's question, I inform him that no person has any authority to say that no further payment will be made before August next. 

##### Mr MAHONEY:<br><small class="text-muted">DENISON, TASMANIA</small>

-- Has the Minister for Commerce received any urgent communication from exporters of apples and pears in Tasmania who have been put out of business because of the inauguration of the apple and pear acquisitionscheme, and will he see that the promise made by the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition, that these men would be given an opportunity to participate in their regular business of exporting apples and pears, will be honoured ? Will he say whether he intends to take any action in the matter? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- Representations along the lines mentioned by the honorable member have been made, both personally and by letter. It would take too long to give details at this stage, but I am prepared to discuss the matter with the honorable gentleman in my office on some convenient occasion. 

##### Mr LANE:<br><small class="text-muted">BARTON, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Is the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce aware that, under the operations of the Apple and Pear Board, fruit agents in Sydney are licensed by the State Government? In view of the fact that a committee appointedby the board has prevented a large number of fruit agents from selling apples and pears, will the honorable gentleman,who, we well know, has interviewed every interest, state what policy he intends to adopt?Will he see that these committees are not allowed flagrantly to prejudice large sellers of apples and pears, and advance the interests of some of their friends who are very small sellers of those fruits?

-- In view of the immense: sales of margarine against the sale of dairy products both in Australia and overseas and in view of the fact that the prices existing to-day in. respect of sales to Great Britain will expireon the 30th June next, will the Minister for Commerce let the House know if he has made any representations for the continuance of the agreement in respect of sales of dairy produce to Great Britain and after that date? And if so, what are the proposals? Can the Minister give any hope that margarine will not continue to affect the sale of dairy products ? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

-- That question is a matter for discussion  between  the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom at present. The disposal of margarine in the United Kingdomdepends very largely on the attitude of the imperial Government. The biggest difficulty is the high price of1s. 7d. per lb. in the United Kingdom at which price butter has. beenfixed which price, of course, is very high in comparison with that of margarine.

Further, will he say whether the employment of foreigners as appraisers is justified, in view of the fact that capable Australian wool appraisers who were willing to act  are  unemployed. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- There are foreign appraisers of nationalities other than French in the employ of the Central Wool Committee. I cannot state the number of such men, but if the. honorable gentleman desires the information,, I shall have inquiries made, although some correspondence and considerable time in searching' forit would be entailed. I point out that before the war, Australian wool was sold to buyers of many; nationalities who had their representatives here. The system of appraisement is based on there being one appraiser to represent the buyer or the prospective buyer, another to represent the seller, the third to be independent I shall look into the honorable member's question, and shall supply him with the best information which it is possible to obtain..

#### AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE

Separation Allowances- Training of Volunteers in Their Own States. 

##### Mr WHITE:

-Will the Minister for the Army investigate the present inequitable basis on which separation allowances are paid to widowed mothers of men who have enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, whereby the mother of an unemployed man receives nothing except the allotment Which is deducted from his pay, whereas in other cases varying amounts are paid ; and will he also bring down some equitable scheme whereby separation allowances will be paid to all? 

##### Mr STREET:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Defence &middot; CORANGAMITE, VICTORIA &middot; UAP</small>

-- Thewhole question of allowances for dependants is at present under reviewby the Government with a view to removing anomalies and inequities wherever they exist. 

##### Mr LAZZARINI:<br><small class="text-muted">WERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP; LANG LAB from 1934; ALP from 1936</small>

-- Will the Minister for the Army inform the House what precautions, if any, are taken by the military authorities to protect the interests of wives and children of soldiers who have gone overseas? I have already furnished the Minister with particulars of two cases in which women otherthan the wives of the soldiers concerned have been drawing separation allowances, while the wives and their children havebeen in want. 

##### Mr STREET:

-- I think that the honorable member's question has probably been covered by the answer which I gave to a previous question. I point out that the records office must accept the declaration of the soldier regarding his dependants. If he makes a false declaration some time must necessarily elapse before the matter can be put right. 

##### Mr NAIRN:<br><small class="text-muted">PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Will the Minister for the Army inform me whether any volunteers in Western Australia for service abroad are now being trained in the Eastern States?Ifso, will he give me an assurance that that policy will be discontinued? 

##### Mr STREET:

-- With the exception of certain technical units, particularly the artillery, the engineers and the signallers, the great majority of the troops will be trained in the States in which they enlist. This procedure will be contrary to the practice adopted in the case of the Sixth Division. 

##### Mr MAHONEY:

-- Will the Minister for the Army take immediate steps by regulation to meet an anomaly in the pay of dependants of soldiers going overseas ? A boy may allot to his mother 2s. out of 5s., but she gets nothing from the Commonwealth Government. Will the Government take the necessary stepsto give 2s. in cases where 2s. is allotted and1s. where1s. is allotted in the same ratio as allotment of 3s.to  wives  are supplemen ted. A lot of theboys going overseas do not understand the position. 

##### Mr STREET:

-As I said earlier the dependants' allowances are at present under review. 

##### Mr Mahoney:

--  Will that aspect be taken into consideration? 

##### Mr STREET:

-- Yes. 

##### Mr JAMES:<br><small class="text-muted">HUNTER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-Is the Minister for the Army awarethat undue hardship is at present being inflicted upon dependants of members of the Australian Imperial Force because of the way in which regulations governing the allotment of soldiers' pay are being administered? In one instance, the details ofwhich I have communicated to the department, an unmarried soldier had made an allotment of pay to his mother. Subsequently he married, but the department refused to make an allotment from his pay to the wife. When representations were made on the matter, she was informed that it would be necessary for her to obtain a court order against her husband.. In another case, a soldier deliberately left his wife, who was in a delicate state of health, without any provision at all, and she had to go tothe court foran order I ask the Minister whether it is a fact that, in that particular case, it was necessaryto obtain a grant from the Lord Mayor's Fund in Newcastleso that the woman might be ableto buy the equipment necessary to enable her to go into hospital for the birth of her child ? 

##### Mr STREET:

-In cases where a court order is made, the soldier is obliged to fulfil that order by an allotment from his pay. To the extent to which the order cannot be met from the soldier's pay, it is made up by the Commonwealth Government. No unnecessary delay occurs in those cases. If a soldier has made an allotment, and subsequently marries, it is necessary for him to make a fresh allotment to his wife before separation allowance can be paid to her. Until that second allotment is made no separation allowance can be made to the wife. The honorable member will realize that that must be so.

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- I understand that the report of  **Mr. Townsend**  was prepared  for  the information of Cabinet. I cannot undertake to lay it on the table of the House.

#### COAL STRIKE

##### Mr JAMES:

-- Having regard to the importance of the coal industry to Australia's economic life, and to the successful prosecution of the present war, does not the Prime Minister believe that it is time the Government called the parties together under the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act, which provides that, in the event of a conference failing, an arbitrator may be appointed to bring about an agreement? If he will not invoke the provisions of this act, which was specifically passed to cover the needs of the extremely intricate coal industry, will he state his reasons to the House? 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- The Government is not prepared to exercise the powers it possesses under the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act, and, in brief, its reasons are that it is not prepared to substitute some other tribunal for the Arbitration Court simply because a decision of the court has not been favorably received by one of the parties to the dispute. 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

-- By both of them. 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- The difference is that one party is observing the award, or would be willing to doso, while the other is not. However, I agree entirely with what the honorable member has said about the great economic importance of the coal industry during the present war, and I only hope that his words will have a very wide circulation in the coal districts. 


 *Later:* 


##### Mr JAMES:

-- Is the Prime Minister aware that in 1929 the coal-owners locked out the coal-miners for fifteen months in spite of the fact that they were working under an award made under the Industrial Peace Act and that his predecessor in the constituency which he now represents withdrew proceedings which had been commenced against the coal-owners? How can the right honorable gentleman reconcile the attitude of the present Government against the workers with the failure of a previous Government to proceed against the coalowners ? 

Is the right honorable gentleman correctly reported in the  *Sydney Morning Herald*  as purposing to go to the coalfields? Was the right honorable gentleman responsible for the statement in that article that the honorable member for Newcastle  **(Mr. Watkins)**  and myself purposed to accompany him? If he was responsible, does he not think that out of courtesy, a member of this Parliament, who represents 80 per cent. of the coal production of Australia, should at least have been informed of his intention to go to the coal-fields and of the text of the talks that he proposes to have with the coal-miners ? 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- I have no knowledge of what took place here in 1929. 

##### Mr Curtin:

-- Oh, yes, you have. 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- With great respect, I have not, and I do not think that I should be asked to study a statement of a predecessor dealing with facts of which I am not aware. 

As for the latter portion of the honorable gentleman's question, I am not responsible for any statement that appears in the press that I may be accompanied through the coal-fields by the honorable member for Newcastle  **(Mr. Watkins)**  or the honorable member for Hunter  **(Mr. James).**  The fact is that I had a conversation yesterday with the honorable member for Newcastle. I endeavoured to have one with the honorable member for Hunter, but he had not then arrived in Canberra. I told the honorable member for Newcastle that I was proposing to go to the coal-fields and would like to learn from him and subsequently from the honorable member for Hunter what were their opinions as to the best place to visit and the best time to go there. When I found that the honorable member for Hunter was not in Canberra I asked the honorable member for Newcastle to be good enough to tell that honorable member what I was contemplating and that subsequently I would get into touch with him. I regret that I have not had the opportunity to-day to do so because I have been almost continuously engaged. I know, however, that messages have been passed to the honorable member for Hunter, and I have the advantage of his view as to what locality I should visit. I am not responsible for what appeared in the press. I made it clear that I did not want to embarrass either the honorable member for Newcastle or the honorable member for Hunter. I realize that they must stand in a position quite independent of a visit by me and that they are in no sense to be treated as responsible for my visit there or for anything I say or do. I make that clear because I know each honorable gentleman has been working to produce a settlement of this dispute. I should be the last to suggest that they would be responsible for any action I took.

-- In view of the serious financial position of the wheat-growers of Australia I ask the Minister for Commerce whether he can give me any indication as to when another advance will be paid in connexion with the No. 2 wheat pool? I should also like to know the probable amount of such advance. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

-- I am unable to indicate either the time or the amount of any such payment at present. 

##### Mr McHUGH:<br><small class="text-muted">WAKEFIELD, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- In view of the fact that only 2s. 6d. a bushel has been paid on the wheat received, and the further fact that the representatives of the wheat industry have requested that a further advance of ls. a bushel be made, I ask the Minister for Commerce when he anticipates being able to make a pronouncement on this vitally important matter? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- In these disturbed times it is not well to anticipate too far ahead. As soon as a pronouncement can he made on the subject I assure the honorable members that it will be made.

I do not suggest that the Minister has information on this matter at the moment, but I have been informed from a reliable local authority that commodities are delivered in the same quantities seven days a week irrespective of the number of men actually in the camp, with the result that there is wholesale waste.I ask that inquiries be made into this matter at once.

Transportation Costs when on Leave.

If so, will the Minister make arrangements whereby they may travel on the railways to their homes at such times without payment? In effect, my question aims at providing free transport to their homes for compulsory trainees while engaged on the King's business. 

##### Mr STREET:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- It has not been the practice to provide free transport for men called up for compulsory training when they go on leave, and I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will realize that the granting of this concession would involve enormous expense.Where it is possible to use army transport vehicles to take men between the camps and the nearest railway stations that is done, but it is not practicable to pay the railway fares of the trainees. The only fares that have been paid by the department have been in respect of pre-embarkation leave for members of the Australian ImperialForce.

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- There is a Capital Issues Board, which was established under the regulation that operates in respect of capital issues. That board deals with certain applications of a major character. Those applications that are of a minor character are dealt with directly by the Treasury. In each case the recommendations are submitted to me, and final approval must be given by the Treasury. Every effort is made to deal with applications as quickly as possible, and very little delay has occurred in respect of any application that has come before the board. If any particular case can be placed before me, I shall investigate it personally.

  >
  >We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your  Excellency  for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. 

I appreciate the honour that has been conferred upon me in my having been asked to move this motion. The House is meeting at the time of grave world disturbance, which is becoming exceedingly dangerous for the people of this country, and every other country with our forms of domestic and national life. The gravest . threats are being made against our independence as a free people, and are being accompanied by the vilest propaganda and the most underhand and treacherous activities that one nation could practice upon a friendly neighbouring country. National and individual morality has receded almost to vanishing point in some countries, and innocent people, whose only desire is to live on friendly relations with their neighbors, are being murdered at the slightest provocation and their property and homes are being confiscated. In those countries liberty is practically non-existent. There i.-- indescribable chaos in the world, and scientific discoveries which should be used  to  promote human happiness are being employed to destroy it and to destroy also the homes and even the lives of the people of those countries. I could go on indefinitely in this way, but there is no need to do so. Everybody must know what is being done. That these things are not abhorred by everybody is a calamity of the first importance, because every ounce of effort that this nation can possibly exert to assist the Allies in their strenuous fight, against these things should be exerted. I say with the utmost deliberation that we are fighting in the defence of civilization. In very truth we are fighting for nothing more and nothing less than civilization itself. Therefore, every effort that we can make in the fight should be made. All rightthinking people will, I am sure, agree with me. Wrong-thinking people, and those who do not agree with this sentiment, should be obliged to submit to the closest investigation of their circumstances, to determine whether they ought to be placed in a position where, if they will not assist the Government, they at least will not be able to hinder it in its war efforts. No praise is too great for the soldiers of this country who have volunteered to fight in its defence and have actually gone, or are preparing to go. overseas to do so. It would be suicidal for us to wait until the battle had to be waged on our own shores. We are fighting for our independence and for civilization, out, if we wait until the battle comes to us, we shall fight a losing battle. Consequently, I desire to pay the highest tribute, to the young men of this country, and of the other Dominions, who have enlisted for overseas service with the. object of endeavouring to  localize the fight, if it is at all possible, in the regions where it is now being waged. 1 appeal to all loyal Australians to assist the Government in the strenuous task it has in seeking to assist the Allies in their fight. 

I appeal also to all honorable members of this House and to all Australian people to drop party politics and fall in behind the" Government so that  out  war effort may be made with our maximum strength. On the front bench on the Government side of the House, we have men of average, and probably  *more*  than average, intelligence; if they were men of only average intelligence, they would be able to do the job that has to be done. The members of the Government are not less loyal than other persons in this community, and certainly not less loyal than their critics. We all know that they are industrious. Moreover, they have available much more and much better advice than any other persons in the community, and certainly than their critics. Mistakes, of course, will be made. They will always be made. But I hold the view that such  mistakes as  have been made by the Government have been mistakes of detail and not of broad national policy. I invite honorable members in particular, and the people of Australia in general, to examine the war effort of the Government. I am sure that if they will do so they will come to the conclusion that the Government has implemented a fair and reasonable policy calculated to give to the Allies the greatest assistance of which we are capable in their very strenuous endeavours to defend our civilization. Helpful criticism, I am sure, will always be welcomed by the Government, but destructive criticism at such a time as this is nothing less than a calamity. I therefore appeal to honorable members to offer constructive criticism and not to engage in criticism of a kind which might be helpful to the enemy. 

The problems which the Government is facing are tremendous. In addition to the ordinary matters that must face the Administration of this country, there i9 the added problem of devising ways and means to market our primary products in circumstances which are most difficult. I nsk the Government to give very serious consideration to these vital matters, for primary production is of immense importance to Australia, I believe that this is the first Government that has attempted to limit profits in this country in wartime. I hope that it will take within its purview many details in this connexion which, apparently, up to date have escaped notice; for in spite of its activities hitherto, certain people in Australia are taking advantage of the circumstances of the country to make undue profits. 

I know that the Government is facing a. very difficult problem in its endeavours to conserve the credit of the country, and to make the best possible use of its financial resources in, the prosecution of the war. I commend it for what it has done in this way. 

I should like to see some additional investigation made into some minor details in connexion with imports and the classification of imports. This subject is causing some irritation. Certain critics of the Government have objected to the classification that has been made of goods, and there is room for additional investigation on this important subject. 

It is, of course, inevitable that extra taxation must be imposed, but if such new imposts as must be ' made are so devised as to ensure that they will fall upon those persons in the  community  who are best able to bear them, . I am sure that the Australian people will be loyal enough to bear them uncomplainingly, heavy though they may be. The Government will have to go on the money market, and it will encounter some difficulties here. 

To all of these problems must be added preparations for reconstruction after the war. Unemployment will have to be provided against and we shall also have to make provision for the well-being of the men who return from abroad. I was glad to notice the reference in the GovernorGeneral's Speech to the intention of the Government to make early preparations for the repatriation of our soldiers. It is not too early to set about the drafting of a comprehensive measure to ensure that the soldiers who come back from this war will receive better treatment than the men who returned from the last war. With the experience that we have had in the last 25 years, it should be possible to evolve legislation which will give much more satisfaction to returned soldiers than was manifested after the last war. 

Butin the midst of all these difficulties the Government is being confronted with thecalamity-and I use that word advisedly-of the coal strike. This strike is a crime against Australia and its people at a time when Australian soldiers are fighting in distant lands. It is a crime against humanity and against the workers in other countries who have appealed to their fellow workers throughout the world to assist them in the fight against oppresssion. As we look around the world to-day we find that in other lands, particularly in the British Empire, the workers are doing their utmost to help the Allies in this fight In New Zealand, where a Labour Government is in office, a magnificent job is being done. In Great Britain also the Labour party is behind the Government. From the Labour party in Norway an appeal for assistance has been issued to workers throughout the world. Yet in Australia one of the key industries of the country is being sabotaged by people who profess to bo true Australians. There are Communists in this country, and therefore I am pleased to see in the GovernorGeneral's Speech an intimation that the Government will take steps to curb their activities. Surely, not all of the men who are On strike are Communists ; surely, not even all of their leaders are Communists ? Should it be found that they are Communists, a very dangerous state of affairs indeed would be revealed-a position which should be closely investigated by the Government. If these men to whom I have referred are not all Communists, I want to see their leaders in this House advise them to end their stupid and traitorous activities. If these men are not all Communists, I charge the trade union leaders, and others, with the gravest acts of disloyalty ever perpetrated in this country. No excuse offered on their behalf will convince ana, or the majority of Australia., that such action is not. disloyal. I have not noticed any efforton the part of honorable members opposite to settle the coal strike, and therefore it would appear that they condone the action of the strikers. I repeat that their action at this time is one of the greatest acts of disloyalty that this country has ever witnessed. An appeal has been made to the Government to settle the strike by the exercise of the power vested in it under the National Security Act; but the very people who have issued that appeal would, at some future date, cite such action to support arguments designed to show why such powers should be refused to the Government. The National Security Act should not be invoked to meet the present situation, and I commend the Government for not taking action under its provisions. I am pleased that the Governor-General's Speech indicates that action will be taken along the lines that I have mentioned. 

I have appealed for unity in the great struggle in which the country is engaged. I appeal to the Opposition in this chamber to drop party politics for the duration of the war, and to get behind the Government in its efforts on behalf of Australia. 

##### Mr Blackburn:

-Does the GovernorGeneral's Speech suggest that party politics have been dropped by the Government? 

##### Mr SCHOLFIELD:

-- I shall conclude by quoting from a speech of a Labour politician in this country two months after the outbreak of the last war, when Labour was in office.  His  statement then is applicable to the present circumstances, and I commend it to the honorable members opposite. The gentleman to whom I have referred then said- 

  >Ibelieve that we have at the head of affairs to-day Ministers who will meet the situation men, bravely and firmly, and do their beet in the interests of the country. I am charitable enough to thinkthat our opponents in theFederal Parliament to-day will join with the Government in this calamitous time, and help them to put matters onas satisfactory a footing as possible in the circumstances. 

I commend the motion to the House. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:<br><small class="text-muted">Richmond</small>

.- It is my privilege and honour to second the motion that the Address be agreed to. In times of peace the Address-in-Reply is a political occasion, but in time of war, and especially at such a critical time as the present, it becomes an occasion of great significance. The motion before the House gives vital and personal expression by each of us to the loyalties and high purposes which guide all British peoples. The supreme task  that  *ties*  before  itsto-day  may well be defined asthe vindication of the freedom ofallpeoples, especially small peoples It is atask  into  which we Australians, althoughnumericallysmall,should throw everyounceof virility, energyand independencethat wepossess; it is a task tothe accomplishment of which  it  is the dutyof the Government to lead the people with 'energy 'and purpose. I am glad, therefore, to note that, since the House last  met,  the weight ofresponsibility falling upon the Administration has been shared by members of the party to which  I  belong. Faced, as weare, by one formidable enemy, covertly threatened by others, and -hesitatingly and feebly assistedby still others who should be our activefriends, we have need for all of the singleness of purpose and high resolution which the AddressiniRepIy expresses. We stand together as a parilamentand as a people  in  'common loyalty to the , great fundamental principles of human rights which  in  British communities are safeguarded by Crown  and  constitution alike - freedom of speech, thought and action; freedom to  Worship, or  not to worship-; freedom to elect and control our own governments ; freedom  from  the violation of our homes; freedom from the fear of the deprivation of our personal liberty, except by the due processes of the law; freedomas a peaceful  and  law-abiding people to go our own ways and live our own lives. These lberties are  in  jeopardy to-day. To-night, I had the privilege of hearing  an  address on international affairs by the distinguished visitor from Great Britain who now occupies a seat on the  floor of  this House. After telling us that he had visited many countries recently and had seen what was going  on  in Europe and Asia, he said " If the  light  of liberty flickers out in England, I do not know where it will again be lighted ". Those words made a  great  impression on my mind, because of the tremendous truth embodied in them. I have mentioned the various liberties  which we  enjoy, but there is  one  qualification inrespect ofthem. Eight down the ages when the very existence of the State has been threatened it has been the  custom  for democracy temporarily to surrender its treasured liberties  to the  executive,andtoconfer upon itextra- ordinary powers in order that the struggle forthe preservationof the state might be mosteffectively waged. Throughout the British realm, as wellas in the great democracy of France, the legislature has givento theexecutive powers which, in peace, it would neverdream ofconferring. By the passingof the National Security Act this Parliament with a minimum of opposition has given tothe Executive,exceedingly wide powers, which  *in*  peace it has reserved exclusively to itself. If the legislature voluntarily restricts its privileges inthenational interest, in myopinion it follows that the liberties ordinarily enjoyed by theindividual must likewise be curtailed ifsuch restriction is in the interest of the security of the State. When therefore, any individual who enjoys civil and political liberty, suchas thiscountry affords, abuses that freedomby engaging in subversive acts of a character likely to assist an enemy and bring about our defeat, a duty devolves upon the Government to step in and protect the state. I therefore welcome that passage in theGovernor-General's Speech which indicates that a less tolerant attitude towards Communist activity and treachery will be shown in the future. Last Sunday afternoon from the outskirts of the crowd I listened to some Communist speakers in the Sydney Domain. I heard 'one of them say that not a man, or a gun, or  a  ship, should leave this country to assist " in this imperialistic war." The man who made that statement-, and those who were with him, were protected by  acordoh  of police to enable them to 'do so. I commend the Government for having at last taken steps toend such a state of affairs, and I hope that the measures foreshadowed in the Governor-General's Speech will be applied vigorously. Our sister dominion of New Zealand has already made some move in that direction. I believe that we can follow its example, and perhaps improve upon it. 

Before I leave that particular subject; I appeal to our friends on the opposite side of the House to give the Government some assistance when it hasto tackle this very difficult problem of dealing with subversive activities. I  am  not endeavouring  to make party political capital out of the circumstances that exist. I am sorry that I am given no credit by one or two honorable members opposite, but I believe that a number of the members of the Opposition appreciate the penetrative tactics of the Communist section of the community, and have very good reason to resent the activities of those persons in their own organizations. One has only to read the newspapers which sometimes circulate as official organs of the Opposition. party, to appreciate that very many members of the Opposition are waging a desperate battle against Communists to-day. 

This is the second occasion during the present generation on which we have been called upon to meet from the same quarter a challenge to the elementary principles I have propounded. The threat to-day is graver than it was on the last occasion, because it comes from a dictatorship which avowedly is out to destroy democracy; a dictatorship that is not only ruthless and aggressive but is also as callous and brutal as was any ravaging horde in the dark ages. It may be equipped .with all of the scientific aid which the twentieth century can give to it, but its methods and ideals are those of many hundreds of years ago. Germany says that it wants colonies. God help ns if it ever had the opportunity to colonize us as it is to-day colonizing Poland, by means of extermination and pillage, free men being driven in hundreds of thousands to work as slaves in order that the Nazi might be in a better position to enslave others, women and children being left to starve or freeze to death, and the firing squad being used for any one who is brave enough to stand up in the name of freedom! 

Behind the programme foreshadowed in  His  Excellency's Speech to-day, matter of fact and material though such things may be, there looms largely the framework of the gigantic effort which Australia is making. Back of that there i3 a still bigger thing, namely, the indomitable will of Australia. When this war, which was not of our choice or making, burst upon us, we took our stand. All sections of this House and all sections of the Australian people instantly took their stand with Great Britain, and there we shall stand unflinchingly until the end. It will cost us much in men and material, in money and effort, but that is the price which we are called upon to pay for our integrity and our existence, for our right and the right of others to live as a peaceful, civilized, Christian people. We are. fortunately, distant from the flash and thunder of hostilities, but no man with any sense of reality can doubt what would be our fate; we should be trampled upon and plundered, as others have been, were it not for the combined might of the British and French peoples. Great Britain has taken the first shock of the assault, lt has held the Nazi in check in the Kattegat, in the Skager Rak,  in the North Sea, with France on the Maginot Line, and with allies and near allies in the south Balkans, where our own troops - the men of Australia, the members of the Australian Imperial Force - are standing ready to lend a hand to drive the Nazi back to his lair when the time to do 30 arrives. The great dominions of Canada,- Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - although we all know that South Africa has its own special and particular problems - count for much in this war, and their combined population of twenty million - 'Canada with ten million, Australian with seven million, and New Zealand with three million - represent almost half as many people - 45 million - as are contained in Great Britain itself. Between us, we possibly represent much more in resources and materials; therefore, we count for a great deal. What Australia does will either influence other dominions to be lukewarm, or encourage them to give of  their  utmost. Our heli) may easily prove to be the decisive factor if it is prompt, immense, and thorough, and if it serves to encourage and inspire our sister dominions, and even Great Britain itself. We are immune from the immediate shock of war. We have no imminent fear of seeing our cities bombed, or our coasts ravaged. We have no distractions. Let us, therefore, put forward our maximum effort, and throw our weight where it will most count. Above all, let us fight where the fighting has to be done, and not wait until it is brought to us. We have, unfortunately, seen others make that mistake. Personally, I believe that an overwhelming numbe'r of 

Australians is behind the Government which makes that plain.I give this Government the credit that it has never equivocated on that issue. Many of us would like to have seen more done than has been done. We should like to see a greater acceleration on the part of the defence authorities. The Air Department should accept the services of thousands of young men throughout this country who are becoming discouraged by the delay that is taking place. Much, however, has been done. Australia got there instantly in the economic phase of warfare, by joining in agreements long previously planned which cut off supplies from the enemy and assured them for our allies. These arrangements are of incalculable economic and strategic value; they are the basic strategy of modern warfare. On this occasion, arrangements were completed within a few weeks which in the last war took years to complete. Australia is getting there, too, with sea, land and air forces. The Empire air scheme, in particular, will help to hold the ring which will keep the Nazi bush-fire from spreading, which will keep it in check and help to beat it back and, I trust, finally beat it out. Here at home our industrial, commercial and financial systems have rapidly been placed on a war footing. The measures already taken are enabling us gradually to increase the total weight of pressure upon the enemy. But despite all that has been done, our effort lags proportionately far behind that of Great Britain; we are still not carrying an equable share of the load. The programme that the Governor-General has outlined, however, foreshadows much more that is to be done. I welcome that, and feel sure that every true Australian will be glad of it. We shall be asked to sanction expenditure and measures of a magnitude never before attained in our history. To me it is a matter of pride that we are strong enough, that we have attained such national growth and that we can rise to such undertakings. If every Australian plays his personal part as he should, adjusting his personal affairs and expenditures to his individual war effort - as I think, when he properly understands the position, he will be ready and eager to do - we shall all be able to provide sinews of war on a record scale; and nothing less will suffice. We can and we should, in this first year of this war, rise to a financial effort as great as, if not greater than, that attained in the last year of the last war. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- I assure the honorable gentleman that we shall do more than that. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:

-- I am glad to have that assurance. It would ill-become any man to view this as a sacrifice. Rather is it our national subscription, our union dues to the greatest union of free people the world has ever known, the price of ourright to strike in the only way we should strike in these days against the tyranny of a foreign dictator who not only would impair our cherished industrial standards and filch our civil liberties, but also would challenge our very right to life itself. I hope that the programme outlined, insofar as it relates to the war, will be entered upon and carried through this Parliament with the support of all sections in this House, with constructive criticism, not only from the Opposition, but also from Government supporters, where argument is needed, and with a full and earnest realization of the duties which Australia expects us to perform. I have pleasure in seconding the motion.

### ADJOURNMENT

{:#subdebate-56-0}
#### Illnessof Mr. Prowse and Mr. Perkins - Sitting Days

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Kooyong &middot; UAP</small>

-- I move - 

  >That the House do now adjourn. 

Honorable members will regret to notice the absence of the  Chairman  of Committees  **(Mr. Prowse),**  in relation to whose absence I moved the previous resolution. I think that I am speaking for all memberswhen I say that I hope that he will be speedily recovered to health. We desire to extend the same message to my friend and former colleague, the honorable member for Eden Monaro  **(Mr. Perkins),**  who has been ill for a considerable time, who is, I am glad to say, making progress, and who hopes to be in his place in the House in a week or so. 

My suggestion about the sitting of the House is that we should sit on Thursday and Friday of this week. Next week, Anzac Day falls on Thursday. It is a close holiday and many honorable members desire to be in their electorates. That is a matter about which I shall have to talk with the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Curtin).**  The House might meet on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. 

Honorable Members.  -  That will not give all of us an opportunity to be in our electorates. 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- I assure honorable members that I am willing to consult the convenience of all. I said to my friend, the Leader of the Opposition, that I should have to meet with him.. My own suggestion, which, in the circumstances, must be tentative, is that we meet on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week to enable honorable members to get away before Thursday. In the following week I would suggest that we meet on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. I shall discuss with the Leader of the Opposition the possibilities of alternating the opening sitting days between Tuesday and Wednesday, as we have in previous sessions, in order to give honorable gentlemen at every alternative week-end an opportunity to visit more distant electorates. 

##### Mr Gander:

--  For how long shall we besitting ? 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- We shall sit until we finish the business. 

Mr.Gander.  -  When will that be? 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- In my more optimistic moments I think a fortnight hence, and in my less, about the end of May': but, between me and the honorable member, I think it will be some time ill June. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Leader of the Opposition &middot; Fremantle</small>

-- It is true that the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Menzies)**  said that he would consultme withrespect to the sitting days next week having regard to the fact that Thursday is Anzac Day, which, in certain States, is invariably regarded as a close holiday and in any eventis fittingly celebrated. The Opposition will share with members of Parliament and the public generally on Anzac Day in paying tribute to the men of Anzac and, in association with other bodies, doing all that is customarily done in that respect. I think that I can say appropriately that Anzac Day this year will indeed have more than usual significance, but I point out to the right honorable gentleman that, if the purpose he has in mind of sitting on Wednesday and then adjourning until the next week, is that members of the House may share in the ceremonies in their own electorates, it is utterly impracticable, except in the case of few honorable members of this House and, indeed, even fewer members of another place. If it is desired that on this occasion we shall make our arrangements with a view to enabling honorable gentlemen to visit their electorates, then indeed we should have to adjourn on an earlier day than Wednesday. There will be a ceremony, in every way a fitting ceremony, performed here at the Seat of Government, and the members of Parliament can attend tha t ceremony. 

##### Mr Menzies:

--  The honorable gentleman will realize that the alternative is to sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday if we are to have three sitting days. 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- That is worse. 

##### Mr Menzies:

--  Or Tuesday and Wednesday only. 

Mr.CURTIN.- It would not be convenient to adjourn on Wednesday and sit again on Friday, but I merely point out  that if we sit on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday- 

##### Sir Earle Page:

-What, about the Tuesday afternoon train? 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">FREMANTLE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1934; ALP from 1936</small>

-- I do not know how that would benefit the Queensland, South Australian and Tasmanian members. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- It is a matter that you and I will have to discuss. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">FREMANTLE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP; FLP from 1934; ALP from 1936</small>

-- Any adjournment which would be at all reasonable would still be impracticable from the viewpoint of Western Australian members. We from Western Australia can view this question with perfect detachment, because none of us will be able to share in any function, except the one that we shall attend here at the Seat of Government. But I do have regard for honorable members generally, and I feel that, if the rearrangement of next week's sittings is for the purpose of enabling members to visit their electorates, it should be such an arrangement as will ensure that the majority will be able to do so. An arrangement which will serve only honorable members from Victoria and New South Wales, whilst convenient to them, is inconvenient to members from the other States. The Opposition will be content if, so long as this House remains in session, sitting days are arranged by the Government, having regard to its duty to prepare the necessary measures for our consideration and for the convenience of the Administration. Whether the House sits on. three or two days next week and then adjourns, we are bore to expedite the Government in carrying out the work of the country. 

Question resolved in the affirmative.
