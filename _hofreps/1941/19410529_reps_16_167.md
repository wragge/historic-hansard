### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-1-0}
#### EVICTION OF SOLDIERS' WIVES

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">PARKES, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- During the last sittings of Parliament I brought to the notice of the Minister for the Interior cases of eviction from houses in the Australian Capital Territory of the wives of certain men serving with the Australian Imperial Force overseas. The Minister promised to consider the matter, and the cases that I mentioned were satisfactorily adjusted. I received to-day from a woman  in  this Territory whose husband has performed valiantly  in  a division in Egypt, a communication stating that she has been notified that unless she pays certain arrears of rent within fourteen days she will be evicted from her home. Will the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior stay the threatened proceedings, and see that the wives of absent soldiers receive fair treatment? 

##### Mr COLLINS:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister without portfolio assisting the Minister for the Interior &middot; HUME, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; CP</small>

-- I shall bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for the Interior, and  Bee  that appropriate action is taken.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-2-0}
#### TREATMENT OF SOLDIERS' DISABILITIES

##### Mr MULCAHY:<br><small class="text-muted">LANG, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the attention of the Minister for the Army been drawn to the statement published last Sunday in a Sydney newspaper, to the effect that soldiers being invalided  to  Australia from Palestine, suffering fromspondulitis, have been refused medical attention? Will the honorable gentleman see that all of those who are returned invalided from this war, as well as returned soldiers of the last war, receive medical attention, whether their disabilities are or are not due to the effects of war service? 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for the Army &middot; WARRINGAH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-- I have had  my  attention drawn to the subject-matter  of  the question, and shall be glad to be furnished with details of  it.  I am not prepared, at the moment, to commit myself in respect of the proposition that medical attention be provided in respect of all men who return from the war., whether their disability be due to war service  or  not, because such a proposition must be subject  to  some time qualification, but I am prepared to approach  it  in a very broad and sympathetic spirit.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-3-0}
#### THE WAR

Statement by Reverend Father Whelan. 

##### Mr PERKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">EDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the attention  of  the Minister for External Affairs been drawn to an article which appeared in the Sydney Sun on the 19th instant, a portion of which reads as follows :  - 

  >The Reverend Father Whelan, who came from Dublin, on his way to Bathurst said: "The Irish people were most anxious to keep right out of the war. They want Germany to lose,but they would not mind England getting abit of a licking just the same. 

If the Minister considers that the views reported to have been expressed by Father Whelan are vile, and repugnant to all true Britishers, including Australians, will he take steps to prevent a repetition of the like, or institute other appropriate action ? 

##### Sir FREDERICK STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for External Affairs &middot; PARRAMATTA, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-- My attention was drawn to the statement referred to by the honorable member. I, in turn, drew the attention of the relevant service department to it. I feel bound to say that, if the gentleman concerned, or those on whose behalf he professes to apeak, are experiencing exultation because .of the mass murder of British civilians, tho desecration of national shrines, the destruction of hospitals and infirmaries, and the sinking of mercy ships, he and they are entirely out of step with their co-religionists in Australia, many of whom have already given their lives, and others their sons, in order that Britain shall administer, not receive, a licking.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-4-0}
#### HOUSING FOR MUNITION WORKERS

##### Mr DRAKEFORD:<br><small class="text-muted">MARIBYRNONG, VICTORIA</small>

-- Will the Minister for Labour and National Service inform me as to whether or not it is. correct, as has been publicly stated, that the Government has decided to build 300 houses for occupation by munitions workers in the Maribyrnong district, the rents for which will be from 27s. 6d. to 32s. 6d. a week? If so, has his department made any investigation of the South Australian housing scheme? If it has not done so, will he have such an investigation made, in order that homes may be built at a cost which will permit the charging of rents that the workers are in a position to pay? 

##### Mr HOLT:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Labour and National Service &middot; FAWKNER, VICTORIA &middot; UAP</small>

-- It is correct that one of a number of projects upon which the Government has decided to embark is the provision of adequate housing accommodation for munitions workers in Footscray. In the very near future 300 homes will be erected in that district, but no decision has yet been reached as to what rentals shall be charged for them. That matter will be determined on the basis of the cost of the houses, which, if present plans reach fruition, will be erected under the auspices of the 

Housing Commission of Victoria, a body that has had considerable experience in the construction of cheap but serviceable homes. I had the privilege, when in Adelaide last week, of investigating houses that had been constructed by the Housing Trust of that State, and a further investigation of them will be made by officers of my department in the very near future. There are certain differences between the costs of land and materials in Victoria and the costs in South Australia; but the honorable gentleman, and other honorable members, may rest assured that the action which the Government is taking will result in the economical construction of homes that will prove both adequate and congenial, and the rents charged will not be at all disproportionate to those of private homes in the neighbourhood.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-5-0}
#### RATIONING OF TOBACCO

##### Mr BADMAN:<br><small class="text-muted">GREY, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether tobacco manufacturers are responsible for the present rationing of supplies of tobacco? In view of the statement reported to have been made by the honorable gentleman, namely, that supplies of tobacco will soon be available from Rhodesia, will he state whether there is any possibility of augmentation of supplies to the public? Will he also make a clear statement of the position in relation to rationing ? 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP</small>

-- The rationing of manufactured tobacco is the responsibility of the manufacturers; the rationing of imports of tobacco leaf is the responsibility of the Government. The statement attributed to me that the agreement with Southern Rhodesia would result in more tobacco being made available is true to the extent that the manufacturers are prepared to purchase additional supplies of leaf in' order to supplement what is available from other sources. The matter raised in the third part of the honorable member's question will receive consideration.

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Defence Co-ordination &middot; KOOYONG, VICTORIA &middot; UAP</small>

-- That principle has been accepted, and the necessary steps to give it application are now under consideration.

(2) Was the matter referred to the Public Works Committee by Parliament for its report? (3) Did that committee make certain recommendations in regard to both temporary and permanent buildings for the new department? (4) Has the Minister ignored the report of the committee, and is he now making arrangements to house the department in Melbourne? (5) Is an old-established firm in Melbourne to be dispossessed of its building, and its business ruined, so that accommodation may be found for the new department? 

##### Mr COLLINS:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

##### Sir FREDERICK STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- All children under the age of sixteen, except, of course, the first, who are maintained by the mother in the circumstances mentioned will be entitled to endowment. Whether the State will continue to give the maximum assistance at the same time is a matter for the State authorities to decide.

##### Mr LAZZARINI:<br><small class="text-muted">WERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I direct the attention of the Minister for the Army to the need for camouflaging a certain building at Port Kembla which at present stands out so clearly that it would be an easy target for attack either from the sea or from the air. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- The matter of camouflaging buildings has -received close attention from the authorities during the last two months. I know the building to which the honorable member has referred, and what he has said about it is correct. Special consideration will be given to the matter.

-- The Government is at present in consultation with the Commonwealth Bank regarding the matter. 

##### Mr BREEN:<br><small class="text-muted">CALARE, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Some time ago I asked the Minister for Commerce a question relating to payments on the No. 2 Wheat Pool 1939-40, and the No. 1 Pool; and the right honorable gentleman replied that a small payment would be made.  To  date, a small payment, amounting  to 1s..00ld.  a bushel, has been made on the No. 1 Pool.

#### COAL-MINING INDUSTRY

##### Mr JAMES:<br><small class="text-muted">HUNTER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- To-day a deputation representing the coal-miners of New South Wales waited on the Minister for Labour in Canberra, and addressed to him certain complaints. Is the Minister aware that a crisis is looming in the coal-mining industry because the coalowners are wilfully and deliberately sabotaging the local boards of reference? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member's remarks are in the nature of comment. He should frame a question. 

##### Mr Ward:

--  It is a good speech. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- It would be a good speech if it were delivered at the proper time. 

##### Mr JAMES:

-- If an industrial upheaval occurs, it would not be a laughing matter. I am greatly concerned about this grave position. If I am not to be allowed to ask my question in my own way, I shall seek leave to make a statement upon it. My purpose in asking the question  *is*  to endeavour to avert industrial turmoil. In order to curtail an attempt by the coal-owners to sabotage the local board of reference, will the Minister amend the regulations relating to the powers of the board so as to prevent the owners from appealing to the central reference board upon questions that concern only the district? 

##### Mr HOLT:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- I heard with interest the representations of members of the deputation which waited on me this morning, and I shall hear with equal interest the views of the employers' representatives upon the matter. If any improvement of the machinery, under which the central and local district boards function, be required, and if that should involve, in turn, any amendment of the regulations, I shall, after consultation with the  chairman  of the board, see that consideration is given to any action that may be deemed necessary.

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order! Will the honorable member frame a question? 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- These materials, it is believed, are finding their way to Germany. Has the Prime Minister investigated the matter, and, if so, will he make a statement upon it? If he has not investigated it, will he do so immediately and make a statement before the House rises at the end of this week? Does the right honorable gentleman approve of the imposition of a political censorship upon the press in order to prevent criticism of the action of the Minister who is implicated in that transaction? If he does not approve, will he take steps to ensure that the censorship is lifted immediately? 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- The whole matter is new to me, but I shall be glad to examine it and make a statement upon it.

-- Details regarding exports to Great Britain for this, the second meat year of the war, have already been fixed. Total shipments to Great Britain will be approximately 198,000 tons.

### REPATRIATION BENEFITS

SirCHARLES MARR.- Months ago, a fishing trawler was lost off the coast of New South Wales and members of the crew were drowned. All my representations on behalf of their widows and children who are suffering as the result of the loss of the breadwinners have brought replies from various departments that, because of the omission of one word from the recently amended Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, the dependants are deprived of repatriation benefits. Will the Prime Minister give urgent consideration to the necessity for amending the act, in order to make those dependants eligible to receive the benefits that it provides?

#### WOOL SUPPLIES

##### Mr LAZZARINI:

-- Will the Minister for Commerce tell the House what is the method of controlling the supply of greasy wool and skins to fellmongers and wool-scourers in Australia? Can the Minister give any reason why works at Liverpool are threatened to be closed, causing 60 or 70 men to be thrown out of work, because those works cannot obtain any supplies of greasy wool or skins? 

##### Sir EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">CP</small>

-Wool for Australian manufacture is dealt with under special terms of the agreement with the British Government, which has purchased the whole of the wool clip. Wool owned by the British Government and outside of the range of those special terms is a matter for the Central Wool Committee and the British Government. The Central Wool Committee, I know from personal investigation, has been in close consultation with the British Government in order to ensure that maximum quantities of wool are available for carbonizing and wool-scouring concerns in Australia. The result has been that in many of the establishments two or three shifts are working at a greater pace than before the war. In the last few weeks, unfortunately, there has not been wool available to the same degree as formerly, with consequent unemployment. The Central Wool Committee is ascertaining to what extent extra wool can be obtained in order to alleviate the position.

#### DECENTRALIZATION OF WAR INDUSTRIES

##### Mr WILSON:

-- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Development whether the Government has come to any decision regarding a change of policy in order to effect decentralization of war industries? 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- The policy of the Government has been to decentralize war industries as much as possible. I can obtain details for the honorable member which, I believe, will prove that statement. 

##### Mr PROWSE:<br><small class="text-muted">FORREST, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Munitions whether, in view of the necessity for an all-in war effort, he will cause an effective survey tobe made of machinery available in country towns of substantial size which could be used to augment the production of munition factories in the capital cities? This would tend to decentralize war production. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- I understand that such a survey is being conducted. I believe that fair progress has been made.

I ask the question for two reasons: first, because our troops overseas are short of equipment; and, secondly, because my stocks are certain to fall if the promise be not honoured. Whereas I am usually unopposed at election time I had an opponent at the last election. 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- I shall do my best to see the honorable member through on this matter. I am a little out of touch with the developments, but I shall ascertain the position.

#### SKILLED WAR WORKERS

Employment Regulations

##### Mr CALWELL:

-- I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether it is a fact that a regulation has been gazetted which limits the rights of employees to transfer their employment? If so, will the Minister consider the gazettal of supplementary regulations which forbid employers to dismiss employees without the permission of the Department of Labour and National Service ? 

##### Mr HOLT:<br><small class="text-muted">UAP</small>

-- A regulation has been in force for some time restricting the right of employers to engage skilled labour, particularly in the metal trades, if they are not engaged in the manufacture of munitions. Last night an additional regulation was gazetted, the effect of which is that before engaging certain classes of employees an employer engaged in munitions work must register with the Department of Labour and National Service such particulars about the employee, including the name and address of his previous employer, as the Minister specifies. The appropriate labour exchange must be notified by the employer of his intention to engage specified classes of employees. In addition, all employers, whether engaged in munitions work or not, will not be allowed in future to invite applications for employment from the specified classes of employees unless they include in the invitation or advertisement a statement - 

  >Applications will not be considered from any person who is engaged in the production, repair, or overhaul of munitions of war, war equipment, or war supplies, unless such person is not actually employed in his usual trade or occupation. 

The question of limiting the right of employers to dismiss skilled labour in the same classifications is under the consideration of the Department of Labour and National Service at the present time.
