#### PUBLICSERVICE PAY AND TAXATION

##### Mr McCALL:<br><small class="text-muted">MARTIN, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Is the Treasurer yet able to furnish the information which I sought last week regarding the making of the new income tax deductions from the salaries payable to public servants on the 2nd April next? 

##### Mr CHIFLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Treasurer &middot; MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- The matter is being examined. The intention is to collect the new tax from all salaries payable subsequent to the first pay-day in April. It has to be understood that any overpayments up to the 31st March will be refunded. I shall furnish a full statement on the matter to the honorable member.

#### AUSTRALIAN ARMY

Hostel Accommodation in Brisbane - Release of Artisan. 

##### Mr CONELAN:<br><small class="text-muted">GRIFFITH, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- The Minister for the Army will recall that during the last few months I have frequently stressed the need for additional hostel accommodation for troops on leave in Brisbane. Does the honorable gentleman consider that the hostel accommodation in that city, including that which is provided by the  new  hostel, St. Oswald's, is still inadequate to meet the needs of troops on leave? Is he in a position to announce the taking over of any additional building in Brisbane, in order to provide further accommodation for hundreds of servicemen, with facilities equal to those that are provided in the new Australian Defence Canteens Service Hostel in Sydney, which he has described as the best hostel in Australia? 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for the Army &middot; CAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND &middot; ALP</small>

-- The matter of additional hostel accommodation in Brisbane has exercised my mind for some time, and on several occasions I have discussed it with  the  honorable members for Griffith (Mr.Conelan)  and  Brisbane  **(Mr. George Lawson).**  The Army decided to take over what is known as St. 

Oswald's building on North Quay, Brisbane, and to have certain alterations and renovations made to it. These were completed recently, and I shall perform the official opening ceremony next Monday afternoon. Since the completion of this hostel, a survey has been made by responsible military authorities in Brisbane of the available hostel accommodation for servicemen in that city. The report furnished indicates that there is still a shortage, particularly of accommodation which will provide indoor entertainment and amenities for men on leave. The policy of the 'Government being to do everything possible to provide adequate hostel accommodation for men on leave, I intend, while in Brisbane, to discuss the matter further with the General Officer Commanding lines of Communication and the Premier of Queensland,  **Mr. Cooper.**  I hope that we shall be able to come to a decision which will lead to the taking over of an additional suitable building. 

##### Mr MARTENS:<br><small class="text-muted">HERBERT, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- On the 31st December, I received from the Minister for the  Army  an acknowledgement of a letter which I had sent to him about an application by a soldier for release to take up his trade as a plumber. I have received from that man a letter enclosing a copy of the Queensland  *Worker,*  in which the Department of Labour and National Service advertises an urgent appeal for plumbers, as well as other tradesmen. Will the Minister for the Army release this man in order that he may take up his trade of plumbing? Alternatively, will the Minister for Labour and National Service cease advertising for plumbers? 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- I shall be glad if the honorable member for Herbert will give me full particulars. 

##### Mr Martens:

-- I have. 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- The honorable member will appreciate that I receive hundreds of letters each day. I do not recall this par.ticular ease. It must be realized that the Army, being largely mechanized, has a need for skilled artisans. "Whilst every consideration will be given to applications for the release of tradesmen, the defence of Australia must be the paramount consideration. I shall look into, this matter and reply to the honorable gentleman later. 


 *Later:* 


##### Mr MARTENS:

-- The Minister said that if I would give him full particulars he would make inquiries into this case. I point out that the man is not being employed as a plumber- 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member is speaking of an individual case. He was asked by the Minister for the Army to state , t lie particulars to him in writing, and I think that the invitation may well be accepted.

#### ACQUISITION OE PRIMARY PRODUCTS

Validity of Regulations - High Court Decision - Blue Peas - Wheat

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">NEW ENGLAND, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- When does the Attorney-General expect to ..be able to make the statement which, on the 26th February, he promised that he would make concerning the effect of the decision of the High Court in the  *Tonking*  case, upon claims that may be made as the result of the compulsory acquisition of primary products ? 

##### Dr EVATT:<br><small class="text-muted">Attorney-General &middot; BARTON, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- On the 10th March, the honorable member for Wilmot  **(Mr. Guy)**  asked me a question in connexion with the acquisition of blue peas. On the 26th February I had undertaken, in response to a suggestion by the honorable member for Indi  **(Mr.**  McEwen)  to make a review generally of the position with regard to the acquisition of commodities, in the light of the High Court's decision in the recent apple and pear case. Such a survey involves many detailed inquiries, but I now place some general considerations before the House. 

In the  *Tonking*  case, the actual amount of compensation to which the plaintiff was entitled was a minor issue, so far, at least, as the court was concerned. The main issue was a general question of constitutional law - whether a grower had the right to have his just compensation assessed, by a court, and not exclusively by the authorities - the Minister acting on the recommendation of the board - which was at that time prescribed by the regulations. The main issue was decided in favour of the grower. The High Court held that the Constitution gave to the grower the right of access to the court. The court, therefore, had itself to proceed to assess the compensation to- which the plaintiff was entitled. At the trial of the original action, no evidence had been given as to the basis upon which growers were being compensated  *de facto*  under the regulations. In consequence of this, the court held that  **Mr. Tonking**  was entitled .to the net proceeds of the sale of the actual fruit which he had produced - which in this particular case were identifiable. But members of the court emphasized that additional evidence might have led them to assess the compensation altogether differently. It is wrong to assume that the  *Tonking*  case lays down a final and irrevocable rule as to the method of assessing compensation for products  compulsorily  acquired and pooled. The court, however, did say in. that case that the grower is entitled to the full value of his fruit; that this alone would be the " just terms " for which the Constitution provides. But the translation of these general propositions into pounds, shillings and pence is a task that cannot finally or satisfactorily be accomplished unless account be taken of the aims, methods and results of the acquisition by the Commonwealth of the commodity concerned. Each scheme depends upon its own organization and methods of compensation. As honorable members will realize, the very existence of a pool in some instances enables a market to be preserved. That, therefore, is one of the relevant circumstances. Without going into detail, I observe that, in considering the " full value " of a commodity that has been acquired, a clear distinction must be drawn between what may be called the " individual " and the " mass " acquisition of property. Where the Commonwealth acquires a particular building or piece of equipment, the acquisition generally leaves the market undisturbed. But the very object of "mass" acquisition is to deal with a threatened shortage or a threatened glut, to create an altogether new, fair and stable market, and to prevent profiteering on the one hand or the collapse of an industry on the other. " Just terms " in 1 such circumstances cannot be fixed merely by endeavouring .to ascertain what price a grower would have obtained for his commodity in an open market. Very often the market has been disturbed, or even destroyed, by the exigencies of war. 

In connexion with wheat, the honorable member for Indi mentioned particularly the special position of what is called " quota" wheat - a grower's first 3,000 bushels - for which a price of 4s. a bushel is guaranteed. I do not think there is anything whatever in the judgments in the  *Tonking*  case which throws doubt on this arrangement. Doubt must rest, I think, on an entire misconception of the facts. They are these : An advance of 4s. a bushel  *is*  paid on the quota wheat. On the residue, ,an advance of 2s. only is paid, but, as sales take place, further advances will be made. In making payments from the pool, the necessary adjustments are made for variations in the quality of the wheat supplied. Additional payments are made to the actual grower concerned, in respect of the small quantity sold as premium  wheat.  For sub-standard wheat, deductions are made from the amounts payable to the grower concerned. The vital point is that the wheat pool - which, 'by the way, includes the proceeds of the flour tax - will in any event pay in respect of all wheat, both quota and surplus wheat alike, the net proceeds of realization, neither more nor less. If the selling price of wheat is insufficient to repay the full 4s. advance on the quota wheat, the difference will be made up from general revenue. Surplus wheat will, therefore, not have to subsidize quota wheat. On the other hand, if the price rose so high as to exceed the guaranteed price plus costs of handling, quota wheat would not have to subsidize surplus wheat. The net proceeds of realization would still be paid by the pool to the grower. 

In most cases of general acquisition, the industry has been faced with a substantial export surplus, for which the war has closed the customary markets overseas. Acquisition has been resorted to in order to avert the disorganization and collapse arising from a glut on the home market. Field peas, to which the honorable member for Wilmot  **(Mr. Guy)**  referred, are an instance of exactly the opposite process - the acquisition of a commodity in short supply. The local demand, especially for Army purposes, has rapidly expanded. The crop is small, too small, indeed, to meet in full Australia's war-time needs. Acquisition was resorted to in order to ensure supplies for Service needs, and to regulate the marketing of any surplus available for civilian use. Price control alone would have prevented profiteering, but would not have secured the other important objectives. The terms of acquisition - 15s. a bushel to the grower - were fixed by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner. 

A court is not necessarily bound to hold that a price fixed by the Prices Commissioner will constitute just terms of acquisition. But the appropriate administrative authority has taken the view that this particular price was just. I have been advised that the price before the war was certainly not morethan 8s. a bushel. Growers themselves know that the price now fixed is both reasonable and payable. They could have got higher prices, no doubt, in an uncontrolled market; the merchants could certainly have got higher prices. Buyers, it is known, had to pay up to 30s. a bushel in. the year before acquisition took place. It is not to be assumed that the Constitution makes the Commonwealth powerless to check profiteering in a case where considerations of defence make it necessary to acquire a commodity that is in short supply. " Just terms " are not necessarily synonymous with getting the very utmost that competition can squeeze out of the necessities of the nation in time of war. 

The commodities I have mentioned may be taken as typical of the mass or general acquisitions put into operation in order, either to rectify the ill effects of shortages in war conditions, or to avert the consequences of over-supply. There are, however, other commodities in respect of which the Commonwealth has not itself acquired and marketed a whole crop, but has obtained large supplies for service purposes, under contracts with processors whose own supplies are controlled by the Commonwealth, at prices fixed by the Prices Commissioner. Tomatoes and citrus fruits belong to this class of commodities. I do not wish now to repeat or amplify the statement I made to the House on this class of transactions as recently as the 26th February. Broadly speaking, it was to the effect that the price fixed by the Prices Commissioner may be examined by a court. 

The principles upon which the Commonwealth has acted in carrying out plans for the " mass " acquisition of commodities have been laid down by successive governments representing all parties in Australia, and have been supported in each case by representatives of the industry concerned. 

##### Mr Archie Cameron:

-- Nothing like that was done in the case of wheat lands. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- That is the exception. 

##### Mr Archie Cameron:

-- It is a remarkable exception, too. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- That is what the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  **(Mr. Scully)**  has pointed out. 

The position arising from the High Court's decision as to the damages awarded in the apple and pear case may have to be clarified in subsequent proceedings. Apparently, the decision lays down no mechanical rule of universal application in the ascertainment of just terms of acquisition. It may well be inapplicable to other circumstances and other commodities. 

Summing up, it may fairly be said - (1)That under the Constitution no property of a citizen can be acquired or requisitioned except on " just terms ". 

{: type="1" start="2"}
0. That the citizen is not necessarily bound by any departmental or governmental assessment of compensation. The citizen has the general right of testing such assessments in the court. 
1. That no general rule can be laid down as to the precise measure of compensation in each case. Each scheme or each acquisition must be governed by its own peculiar circumstances. The just measure of compensation in any given instance depends upon the particular circumstances of the acquisition concerned, and these may and do vary greatly, not only from industry to industry, but from season to season as well. 
2. That perhaps the best working rule to be adopted both by departments and by growers or owners is to obtain agreement - in advance if possible - as to the compensation payable ; whilst no department can itself be the final judge as to the fair compensation, the owner or grower should also be ready to reach agreement if there is any dispute as to what, in all the circumstances, is fair compensation. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- Will that principle be applicable in the case of leasehold land which is not ta.ken over for the whole term of the lease, but for a period only ? 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- The same general principles apply in the case of fixed property. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- Is it proposed to prescribe the court in which the claim shall be heard, or is that to be left to the claimant ? 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- Each set of regulations prescribes the method of arriving at compensation. In the apple and pear claims in New South Wales, there is an appeal from the board to a district court. The growers are anxious to know what price their commodity realized in the market, and I understand that the Department of Commerce and Agriculture will supply that information.

### COMMONWEALTH POWERS BILL

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA</small>

-- In view of the success of the campaign of sabotage which has resulted in all the States of the Commonwealth except two failing to pass the Commonwealth Powers Bill will the Attorney-General take early action to submit to the people by way of referendum the Commonwealth proposals for a transfer of powers from the States to the Commonwealth and other proposals of a like nature so that the people shall determine whether this Parliament should have adequate powers to deal with problems which may arise in the postwar period ? 

##### Dr EVATT:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The present position was stated by the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  a few nights ago on the motion for the adjournment of the House. New South Wales and Queensland have passed the bill in the form agreed to at Canberra. In no other State has the bill been passed in that precise form. The Tasmanian upper house rejected the bill, but the Premier of Tasmania has prorogued Parliament and will call it together again in an attempt to have the bill passed in a satisfactory form. Consideration of the bill has not yet been completed in Western Australia. As the Prime Minister said, we cannot announce what will be done until we know what has been done by the State Parliaments; but, as the Prime Minister also said, the Commonwealth is determined to have the powers it will need to deal properly with all matters of post-war reconstruction.

### MEAT INDUSTRY

Mi-. FRANCIS. - In the absence of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government proposes to set up a new body to replace the Meat Industry Commission which ceased to function following the Senate's disallowance of the Meat Industry Regulations? If not, for what period is it proposed that  **Mr. j.**  Tonkin, of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, shall continue as controller of the meat industry? 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; FREMANTLE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP</small>

### AUSTRALIA SUPPORTS FOOD PLANNING

{:#subdebate-6-0}
#### London, Wednesday

In a leading; .article on the announcement that  **Dr. Evatt**  will urge upon Allied leaders the need for united action to ensure steady,, adequate supplies of food at prices fair to both consumers and producers, " The Times " says it is natural that whole-hearted support for  **Mr. Roosevelt's**  initiative concerning a food1 conference should come from Australia. 

For two years the Commonwealth has been emphasising the importance of this matter and also the importance of linking international trade policies with nutrition policies. 

Will tho Attorney-'General before he leaves Australia announce his attitude on the whole question of food planning and afford the House an opportunity to discuss it? 

##### Dr EVATT:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- "The Prime Minister has already enunciated government policy in a statement which I think should appeal to all parties -in the House.

#### RUBBER SUBSTITUTES

##### Mr JOHNSON:<br><small class="text-muted">KALGOORLIE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Early this month I left with the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research a solution taken from the wild fig tree of the Kimberleys in Western Australia, which, according to the government analyst of Western Australia, carries a high percentage of rubber. I now ask the Minister whether the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has investigated this solution and whether he is able to announce the result to the House ? 

##### Mr DEDMAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for War Organisation of Industry &middot; CORIO, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- The solution which the honorable gentleman left with me a fortnight ago was sent to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for analysis. Unfortunately the analyst was absent in the country on work connected with the retting of flax and there has been some slight delay in having an analysis made. While awaiting the result of the analysis, I have had inquiries instituted . as to the distribution and the extent of the fig tree in the Kimberleys and other localities and as to the man-power which would be required for tapping. As soon as the result of the analysis is available, I shall communicate it to the honorable member.

#### UNIVERSITY STUDENTS

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- O wing to the dissatisfaction of professional men, parents and children of school leaving age who hope to embark on a course of university study, I ask the Minister for War Organization of Industry whether he will give consideration to replacing the academic credit system by a system which has regard to the qualifications of each student for a particular faculty? Will the Minister make arrangements to enable the entry into the medical schools this year of as many students as were admitted to it last year? If further teaching facilities are needed, will they be provided? 

##### Mr DEDMAN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- Selection of students for admission to the universities is made by the university authority and I do not in any way control that. It must be borne in mind that the medical course occupies five and a half years. The question arises as to whether we should allow a large number of medical students to undertake a course which will last for five and a half years, when we know that to do so would subtract from the man-power available for the war effort in other directions, including other courses such as engineering, which are shorter than the medical course. The whole matter has been examined by the Universities Commission, and it has fixed the quota, after having taken all the facts into consideration. It advised the man-power authorities as to the numbers in each faculty that it thought desirable this year, and the man-power authorities have given effect to its recommendations.

-- Will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of making a statement on the war situation to a secret meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives before the termination of this session? 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I shall consider the matter, but I do not see any occasion for holding a secret meeting for the purpose of discussing the state of the war. If any developments should occur between now and next week that warrant an alteration of that view, I shall naturally be influenced by them. 

##### Mr CALWELL:

-- Has the Prime Minister read in the daily press that Australia's war strategy was drastically revised after General MacArthur assumed command of the South-west Pacific front? The article read,inter  *alia -* 

  >Our defence plan then conceived that the islands to the north would be lost and that North Queensland and Darwin would be overrun. Provision had been made for an organized resistance behind a line drawn west from Brisbane. General MacArthur considered the conception of this strategy defeatist and fatal to Australia's safety. 

In view of the implications involved in the statement, will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of making a statement to the Senate and the House of Representatives, preferably in secret, before the recess, concerning the defence of the Commonwealth? Will the right honorable gentleman particularly relate what action was taken against those responsible for devising such a policy? Are those persons still associated with Army administration? 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- I have not seen the article in the press, and I do not propose ro review here the arguments for and against war strategy eighteen months or two years ago. War is a changing problem. Japanese attacks on Singapore, Pearl Harbour and Australia completely transformed the whole character of the relationship of Australia to the war with the Axis. That, at least, is clear. That change occurred since this Government assumed office, and it has exerted every effort, in the closest co-operation with, and with the guidance of, the High Command, to ensure that Australia will be held and that the enemy will be resisted. At the same time, we are doing everything in our power to advance the cause of the United Nations in all theatres. 

##### Mr McEwen:

-- The Advisory War Council has co-operated with the Government. 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- The Advisory War Council, which was established before the present Government took office, has functioned continuously since October, 1940. The fact is that we have held this country, not only by the valour of our soldiers, but also with the substantial aid of our Allies. We have also rendered substantial aid to them. The task now confronting us is to exert our maximum effort because vital issues are at stake. I do not propose to hold post  mortems  a3 to what might or might not have happened in certain circumstances. What I propose to ask" Australia to do is to concentrate upon the task which lies ahead of us, and by doing all that we humanly can, make certain that the directives given to our commanders shall be supported by the maximum cooperation of the people. This week marked the first anniversary of General MacArthur's arrival in Australia. He has not only been a great organizer against a common enemy, but has also become an inspiring force to this nation. I desire my view to be known that if General MacArthur had been Australian-born and had served all his life in the Australian Army, he could have done no more for the defence of Australia than he has done as an American-born citizen and an officer of the United States Army.

#### CENTRAL WOOL COMMITTEE

##### Mr RANKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">BENDIGO, VICTORIA</small>

-- Will the Prime Minister arrange for reports and any documents in the possession of the Government, setting out the views of the Central Wool Committee, to be laid on the table of the House? 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- Many of the documents in the possession of the Central Wool Committee relate to negotiations with another government on the price to be paid for our wool clip, and to other matters, and no good purpose would be served by laying them upon the table of the House. If the honorable member desires information about a specific matter, I shall endeavour to obtain it for him; but I cannot undertake to lay on the table papers which I have not seen and which may involve confidential consultations with another government.

#### VOLUNTEER DEFENCE CORPS

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">REID, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Will the Minister for the Army indicate whether any progress has been made in the training of units of the Volunteer Defence Corps in factories engaged in war production? Some time ago, the Minister announced that war workers would be given training in order that in the event of the invasion of this country, which still seems to be a possibility, they would be able to assist the fighting forces in making a stand against the enemy. 

##### Mr FORDE:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The war establishment of the Volunteer Defence Corps was recently increased to include some thousands of supernumeraries who had not been associated with the Volunteer Defence Corps organization. 

##### Mr Francis:

-- How many? 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- For security reasons, I shall give that information to the honorable member privately. 

##### Mr Morgan:

-- Is progress being made with the training of the war workers ? 

##### Mr FORDE:

-- Generally speaking, the Volunteer Defence Corps organization encourages persons to enlist not from the factory in which they work, but in the locality in which they reside. In a few instances, certain men employed in special industries have been enlisted, and given special training in the part that they shall play in the event of an attack on the factories engaged in war production in which they are employed.

#### SYDNEY BAKERS' STRIKE

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Did the Prime Minister read in the  *Sydney Morning Herald*  a statement by the  president  of the Bakers Union,  **Mr. Kerr,**  that "he would do his damnedest to see that this fight is brought to a successful issue"? Does not the right honorable gentleman consider that the failure of the Government to take firm action against striking coal-miners is encouraging strikes in other industries, such as the baking industry, and that industrial troubles may spread even to war industries? Will the Prime Minister take immediate action to force those engaged in the baking industry to observe the terms of their award, and return to work? 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The baking industry in New South Wales is governed by State law and State instrumentalities. No federal jurisdiction is applicable to bakeries. I do not know what the  president  of the union said. He may have made it very clear that he would do his utmost to bring the matter to a successful termination. The sooner the strike ends, the better it will be for all concerned. I regret very much that this difficulty has arisen, but I am certain that the honorable member will not ask me to usurp the authority of the law of New South Wales.

#### HORSE-SHOES

##### Mr COLLINS:<br><small class="text-muted">HUME, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I ask the Minister for War Organization of Industry to inform the House of the names of the persons who advised him as to the suggested standardization of horse-shoes to which I referred yesterday. Will he say how it is proposed to standardize horseshoes ? 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- This question comes within the same category as the question asked by the honorable member for Herbert earlier to-day. I do not think that it requires an answer. 

##### Mr Collins:

-- I rise to order. My question in relation to horse-shoes is most important to people in rural districts. I wish to know who advised 'the Minister on this subject, and whether it is proposed to make the horse-shoes of one size. Such a proposal would be ridiculous, because, like the feet of human beings, the hoofs of horses vary in size. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Yesterday the honorable member asked two questions on this subject, and I should have thought he had exhausted his inquiries, at least on the ground of urgency. 

##### Mr Collins:

-- I should like you to examine my question,  **Mr. Speaker.** 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- I shall be pleased to do so. 


 *Later:* 


##### Mr COLLINS:

-- I ask the Minister for War Organization of Industry to inform the House of the names of the persons who advised him as to the suggested standardization of horse-shoes. Will the Minister explain how horseshoes are to be standardized? 

##### Mr DEDMAN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The honorable member is a long way behind the times. Horseshoes were standardized a good while ago. It was found that an excessive number of types and varieties was being manufactured, and, after consultation with certain persons, it was decided to standardize horse-shoes with the object of reducing the number of types being manufactured, thus effecting economy in the use of material. I cannot, at the moment, give the House the names of the persons who were consulted, but I assure the  honorable member that many varieties and styles of horse-shoes are still procurable. The standardization has not been to one size and design. I shall furnish more information to the honorable member later.

#### LAND TAX IN NEW SOUTH WALES

##### Mr SPOONER:<br><small class="text-muted">ROBERTSON, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Is the Treasurer aware that a bill for the purpose of imposing State land tax upon certain rural lands is now before the Parliament of New South Wales ; further, that taxes payable under that measure shall be deductible from the gross incomes returnable by taxpayers for Commonwealth income tax purposes ? Will the Treasurer inquire whether the effect of this measure is that the Commonwealth will pay indirectly a considerable contribution to the funds of the New South Wales Government, and also whether the measure constitutes an infringement of the spirit, if not the letter, of the uniform income tax agreement? 


 **Mr. CHIFLEYS** have gleaned from questions that the honorable gentleman has previously asked that the Government of New South Wales is proposing to apply a form of land tax for the purpose of breaking up large estates. I have not examined the bill in detail, and the Commonwealth Government has no intention of considering State action in regard to land tax. I shall, however, examine the point referred to by the honorable member in relation to Commonwealth income tax assessments.

-- 1 ask the Minister for Health whether a proposal has been made to replace the bush nursing system by forming an A class centre in selected districts, determined by a governing body, the policy of which is to be fixed by a board in Canberra? If so, does the proposal, in respect of Victoria, involve the replacement of small hospitals by a small centre which has no hospital and will not provide for midwifery, surgery and other in-patients? What is the reason for such action? 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Health &middot; MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- I am not aware that any such proposal has been made. The Bush Nursing Association does not come under the control of the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Department of Health is taking steps, in collaboration with  **Sir James**  Barrett, and other persons in Victoria, with the object of ensuring that man-power and other facilities shall be made available to maintain nursing services; but that proposal has nothing to do with such a scheme as the honorable member has mentioned.

As both the Army and the civilian population are experiencing the shortage, what action is intended with a view to improving supplies? Will the honorable gentleman confer with the Minister for the Army, in an endeavour to have returned to the land many farmers' sons who are anxious to engage in the production of such foodstuffs ? 

##### Mr BEASLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Supply and Shipping &middot; WEST SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- I do not know of any vegetables of which the Army is in short supply. 

##### Mr Anthony:

-- The honorable gentleman made that statement yesterday. 

##### Mr BEASLEY:

-- I did not say that the Army was in short supply. Thank God., steps have been taken to maintain supplies of everything that is needed by the Army; that is something of which we all are proud. It is true that there are shortages of certain lines for the civilian population. A lot of causes could be stated, and perhaps the cause mentioned by the honorable member would rank prominently among them. I find it difficult to reconcile constantly the maintenance of the strength of the fighting forces on the one hand, and the needs of the civilian population on the other hand, in a way that would give satisfaction to all. The Minister for the Army is doing his level best to strike a proper balance between the needs of the Army and the requirements of the civilian population. I hope that the House will act reasonably in this matter, and recognize that the Government is making the defence of this country its paramount concern.

### AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION BILL 1943


 *In committee:* Consideration resumed from the 17th March (vide page 1916). 

Clause 2 (Commencement). 

Upon which  **Mr. Spender**  had moved by way of amendment - 

  >That the clause be postponed -  as an instruction to the Government -  that wherever in this bill the rates of pen - sion payable under the principal act have not been increased by 50 per centum they should be so increased. 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wentworth</small>

-- Last evening, the committee witnessed an extraordinary display by the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  of agile footwork. The honorable gentleman moved from point to point in a manner resembling the little animal which jumps from peak to peak, but he was not nearly so sure-footed. In an endeavour to justify the increase of 20 per cent. which the Government proposes to give to the returned soldiers, he used the basic wage as his measuring rod, and said : " This is theresult at which I have arrived." I have heard from members of the special committee which investigated repatriation matters many explanations of the manner in which it had arrived at the increase of 20 per cent. The  deputy chairman  of the committee  **(Mr. Watkins)**  said that it was " a deduction from common sense ". Members of the committee who sit on this side of the chamber have made other observations. I direct attention to the comments of the Minister. In order that the committee may have some idea of how he shifted his ground, I point out that when he endeavoured to justify the increase of 66  per cent. in respect of children, he used a different measuring rod. He then said - 

  >The proposed increase is substantially the same as that recommended by the parliamentary committee, and the Government is of the opinion that it is justified, having regard to the increase of the cost of living since the commencement of the war-- 

That was his first point - the general increase of wages-- 

That was his second point - the present rate of pay of members of the forces, and the amendments which have been made in the rates of invalid and old-age pensions. 

He thus forsook the measuring rod of the basic wage, and relied on other factors, which are just as relevant to the increase of 20 , per cent. as they are to the increase of 66 per cent. If the honorable gentleman uses a given basis to justify an increase of 66 per cent., I can see no reason why he should not use it also in relation to the amendment of the honorable member for Warringah. Does he regard it as fair that he should use the basic wage - which is the lowest amount necessary to maintain the standard of living in this country - as the measuring rod in computing the repatriation benefits that should be given to returned soldiers? I do not consider that it is. I should rather expect the honorable gentleman to be generous, and to say that the returned soldier is at least entitled to the basis upon which the wage of the average adult worker is computed in Australia to-day. If he were to adopt that course, he would find that, as I pointed out in my second-reading speech, the difference between the normal adult wage to-day and that paid in 1919 is 47 per cent., not 20 per cent. or less. The honorable gentleman said last night that no argument had been advanced in favour of an increase of more than 20 per cent., and that the organizations of returned soldiers were not interested in any different amount; otherwise, they would have sought it from this Parliament. The members of the special committee have said repeatedly that no evidence was placed before them by any organization of returned soldiers in advocacy of a greater increase than 20 , per cent. Evidence has been placed before honorable members that, notwithstanding the statements of the Minister and of members of the committee, the Victorian branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia asked for an increase corresponding to the increase of soldiers' pay, which is 41.67 per cent. If the Minister was aware of this he has deliberately clouded the position; if he was not, he had been misinformed. If the committee was aware of this fact, and suppressed it, it was at fault in so doing. The fact is that the returned soldiers of Victoria asked for an increase of 41.6 per cent., whilst those of New South Wales asked for an increase of 50 per cent. 

##### Mr Coles:

-- The honorable member for Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald)**  mentioned that fact in his speech. 

##### Mr HARRISON:

-- Then I have done him an injustice, and I am sorry. I did not hear him. However, the Minister did not reveal that fact in his statement. If he was in possession of it he had no right to say what he did last night. He has been moving from foot to foot in an endeavour to justify his attitude in regard to the 20 per cent. increase, and he is not making too good a showing. I draw attention to the following paragraph which appears on page 4 of the committee's report :  - 

  >The committee found that there was reasonable ground for a general increase of the rates of war pension. An outstanding factor in this regard was the comparison of rates of pay to members of the forces and allowances to their dependants with the same items in respect of the 1914 war. 

If that was the opinion of the committee, and it knew that the soldiers' pay had increased by 41.67 per cent., I still cannot understand why it recommended an increase of pension rates by only 20 per cent. The increase might, in view of the evidence, have been fixed at something less than 50 per cent., but, having regard to the depreciation of the value of money, and to the increased cost of living, the figure might well have been fixed at 50 per cent. rather than something between 41 per cent. and 47 per cent. The Government should accept the amendment. It has been frequently stated during this debate that pensions could not be increased by more than 20 per cent. because the Government could not find the money. References have been  made to the depreciation of the pound and to the Government's heavy commitments. We have been told that it would be impossible for the Government to carry on in the face of ever-increasing demands upon the Treasury. I cannot accept those arguments in the light of what the Government is, in fact, doing. If pensions be increased by 50 per cent., the extra burden on the Treasury will amount to about £2,500,000, which will be used to reimburse fighting men who have suffered disabilities while defending our freedom and standards of living. Those standards enable industrial workers to earn from £15 to £20 a week, and cooks employed by the Allied Works Council to earn up to £30 a week. We are told the Government cannot afford an extra £2,500,000 for returned soldiers, yet it has brought down a national welfare scheme which is to cost, not £2,500,000, but £30,000,000. Does the Minister say that for the fighting man who has left his wife and children, perhaps in penury, while he goes to fight in defence of the country and suffers disability in the course of his service, this money cannot be found, although £30,000,000 can be found for the benefit of those who are already earning £15 and £20 a week? 

Let us see whether the national income is able to stand this increase. Let us compare the position as it obtained immediately after the last war with the present position. I quote the following figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician : - 

In the light of those figures how can honorable members say that the country cannot afford an additional £2,500,000 for disabled returned soldiers? 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The honorable member has exhausted his time, but if no other honorable member wishes to speak he may take his second period now. 

##### Mr HARRISON:

-- The Government has entered into various commitments for the manufacture of munitions and other war materials. I have here a list of names of men employed by one such firm. There are 46 of them, and the weekly earnings of these men range between £16 and £25. The average for the 46 cases was £20 7s. a week. But I direct the attention of the committee to the fact that, whilst only fifteen men out of the 46 worked 44 hours' ordinary time a week, a number worked 26 hours' ordinary time and 32£, 42J and 44 hours' double time. They received as high as £25 a week, while the men fighting in the ranks in the Army receive 8s. 6d. a day. For the industrial worker, the Government is establishing a national welfare fund, into which will be paid £30,000,000 a year, but it cannot find £2,500,000 in order to increase repatriation pensions by 50 per cent., as it should do in accordance with the comparative daily wages paid to soldiers in the last war and this war. The committee cannot sidestep these facts. The Minister for Repatriation will not dodge the issue by moving from one foot to another in endeavouring to justify the proposed increase of 20 per cent, on the one hand and 66^ per cent, on the other. The Minister must give better reasons than he has given for the 20 per cent, proposal before the committee will support it rather than the amendment moved by the honorable member for Warringah. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

.- Like the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  and the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison),**  I should like pensions for returned soldiers and their dependants to be much more liberal than is proposed in the bill, and I am sure that all honorable members share that view. The fact remains that the all-party committee, on whose report this legislation was framed, and which was composed entirely of returned soldiers, recommended that pensions be increased by 20 per cent. 

The reasons for that recommendation have been given by the  chairman  of the committee, the honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard),**  and other honorable members. The proper way in which to handle this matter is not by delaying the passage of this measure, but by referring the matter to the standing committee on repatriation, which is to be set up. I do not want to delay giving effect to the committee's recommendations for one moment longer than is necessary. The Government has made its financial arrangements for this year in accordance with the terms of this bill. I remind honorable members that the Senate challenged this House the other day. If there were an election and a change of government, there would be no guarantee that this legislation would be proceeded with. The honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  was Minister for Health in the government which introduced the national health and pensions insurance scheme, but did not proceed with it because it could not find £2,000,000 with which to do so. It was left to a Labour government to introduce a national welfare scheme for the people at large and this bill for the benefit of returned soldiers. I point out to honorable members that the agitation has not been against the proportionate increase of the pensions so much as against the meagreness of the pensions themselves. The Sydney  *Daily Telegraph*  carried out its agitation for an all-round increase of repatriation pensions on -the ground that men wounded in heavy fighting abroad were given pensions so parsimonious that they had to go to work before they were fit. The municipality of Narrandera circularized other municipalities in an endeavour to create an agitation for an increase of repatriation pensions. The circular set out - 

  >There are men in Narrandera who have been discharged from service in the present war as medically unfit, and for pension are receiving a mere pittance. To receive only a small pension the onus is on the discharged man all the time, and he has to fight hard to secure even a small pension. No doubt there are similar cases in your area. 

The complaints that the pensions are parsimonious would not be overcome by an increase of 20 per cent., 50 per cent., or, in some cases 100 per cent. The problem is one of administration. Many of the complaints of returned soldiers in that respect will be overcome by this legislation. For instance, the onus of proof is transferred from the appellant to the  Repatriation Commission, and the medical boards, assessment tribunals and entitlement tribunals. I think that that will ensure a larger measure of justice to applicants for pensions. Legal aid will be provided to returned soldiers in placing their claims before the various tribunals. The personnel of the commission is to be increased, and thereby the administration will, be strengthened. One of the most important improvements of the repatriation system will be the creation of the standing committee. Whatever complaints arise will be investigated and reported on by that committee. That should overcome many anomalies. When the strain of war is ultimately lifted, this country ought to be able to bear a larger increase of war pensions because the increased productivity of war-time should be reflected in peace-time. If this Government remains in office, further sympathetic consideration will be given to the matter. Honorable members should not accept the statement that an increase of the rate of pension by 50 per cent, will involve an additional annual expenditure of only £2,500,000. When repatriation benefits are granted to returned soldiers from the present war, the annual pensions bill may be £20,000,000 or £30,000,000. Consequently, it is erroneous to contend that an increase of the rate of pension by 50 per cent, will not involve a substantial additional sum. Parliament should ensure that the increase recommended by the parliamentary committee is granted, and if some honorable members still consider that the pension is inadequate, the matter should again be submitted to the committee for consideration. 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Wakefield</small>

-- The Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost),**  in introducing this measure, stated that the recommendation which is now -being attacked by this amendment was probably the most important provision in the bill, because it increases the rate of war pensions by 20 per cent. The estimated cost of the increase immediately is £1,620,000 per annum. Consequently, honorable members have now reached the heart of the bill. Those who were not members of the parliamentary committee have the responsibility of seeing that returned soldiers are treated fairly." 

I approach this matter, not with highflown disquisitions upon the cost of living, or with comparisons with the cost of living in the past, but from the standpoint of common sense, as the honorable member for New England  **(Mr. Abbott)**  advocated yesterday, although there was some doubt whether he displayed that qualification to the degree which we believe him to have it. What is the position regarding this recommendation? First, the increase of 20 per cent, was recommended by the parliamentary committee, whose proposals, in the main, are incorporated in the bill; secondly, this recommendation has been approved by the Government. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- Presumably after scrutiny by the Repatriation Commission. 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:

-- One imagines that would be so, because the Repatriation Commission is the responsible body. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- Surely the commission should not decide whether the rate should be increased by 20 per cent, or any other figure ! 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:

-- Amendments of the Repatriation Act may be properly referred to the Repatriation Commission for opinion, although Cabinet makes the final decision. 

##### Mr Harrison:

-- Does the honorable member suggest that the Repatriation Commission should be asked to express an opinion as to whether the pension should be increased by 20 per cent, or 50 per cent.? 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:

-- Yes. 

The  **CHAIRMAN (Mr. Prowse).Order!**  The honorable member for Wakefield is not obliged to answer the interjections of the honorable member for Wentworth. 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:

-- I am delighted to answer them. From his ministerial experience, the honorable member should know that it is only common sense for a Minister to consult with his department regarding .action to be taken. My third point is that returned soldiers' organizations in all States, with only one exception, have approved the increase of 20 per cent. Many returned soldiers live in my electorate, and at their request I sent the relevant documents on repatriation post-haste to some of them for their consideration, because they desired to examine them and give to members the benefit of their views. It may be only chance, but weeks have elapsed since I despatched those papers, and not one of the sub-branches has written to me to express its opinion upon the matter. From- their silence, I can only assume that they are, on the whole, satisfied ; they do not consider that an increase of 20 per cent, is unreasonable. 

I am never over-inclined to give away to any committee my own right of personal judgment. A committee is advisory. Honorable members have the right to decide whether they will adopt its recommendations. But the six members of the parliamentary committee represented very different political views, and each member personally had qualifications to express an opinion on this matter. Two members of the committee -  **Senator Collett**  and the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  - were former Ministers for Repatriation.  **Senator Collett**  is a man of very fair judgment. For that matter, I do not query the judgment of the other members. I have much respect for the honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard),**  who made an excellent speech on this subject, just as did the honorable member for Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald).**  The honorable member for Moreton is never inclined to underrate the claims of returned soldiers. Their recommendation of an increase of 20 per cent., taken in conjunction with governmental approval, and the approval, tacit or expressed, of the soldiers' organizations, makes a very strong case for the adoption of the proposed increases. I go so far as to say that, although Government supporters, in general, are not so enthusiastic about the claims of ex-soldiers as are honorable members on this side of the committee, such an imputation cannot be made against the three members of the Labour party who sat on this committee. It is not for me to set my judgment against that of the members of the committee on this subject. It is regrettable that six months should have elapsed since the committee's report was furnished. Undoubtedly, some increase of the cost of living has occurred in that period, and further increases will occur in the next six months; hut no evidence has been submitted to show that the increase in the last six months has been exactly 15 per cent., or 20 per cent.; in fact, 50 per cent, may be a more likely figure than .20 per cent, in the near future. In my opinion, we cannot dispose of this subject properly by adopting a ceiling or a floor, for it should be considered in relation to the cost of living. The honorable member for New England  **(Mr. Abbott)**  intends to move an amendment on that point, and I hope to speak to it in due course. It has been claimed that, if war pensions be increased by 50 per cent., the process of inflation will be accelerated ; but such action would not have anything like the same accelerating effect as other Government actions are likely to have. This Parliament has just agreed to establish a national welfare fund, into which an amount not exceeding £30,000,000 is to be ' paid annually. That figure is considerably greater than the £7,000,000 expended annually for war pensions, to say nothing of our invalid and old-age pensions bill of £22,000,000 per annum. As the cost of living figures have been related to invalid and old-age pensions, surely they should be related to war pensions, for, with all due respect to invalid and old-age pensioners, this country owes far more to its war pensioners. I am concerned to ensure that ex-soldiers and their dependants shall receive a fair deal ; but I am not here to urge that war pensions shall be increased by 50 per cent, if I do not consider that such an increase is justified. I consider, however, that war pensions should retain their value in relation to the purchasing power of money. I intend to vote for the clause, and I shall do so with a perfectly clear conscience, though doubtless some of my constituents will disagree with me on the point; but I consider that a more scientific approach should be made to pension rates, and that they should be varied in accordance with the increase or decrease of the purchasing power of money. 

##### Sir FREDERICK STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">Parramatta</small>

-- Despite the innuendoes that have been thrown across the chamber to the effect that honorable members who are supporting an increase of war pension rates by 50 per cent, are actuated by political motives, I have not the slightest hesitation in supporting the amendment. The Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  has said that this proposal has no scientific basis.  His  statement waa not original ; in fact, it could have been taken from my second-reading speech, for I admitted that a completely scientific basis could not be found for a 50 per cent, increase. I pointed out, however, that a basis could be found for an increase of 42 per cent. The rates of pay of soldiers in this war are 42 per cent, in excess of the rates of pay of soldiers in the last war. But, if a scientific basis cannot be shown for a 50 per cent, increase, neither can one be shown for the Government's proposal to increase the rates by 20 per cent. Last night, the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  tried, persistently, but in vain, to get the Minister to indicate the basis of the 20 per cent, increase. I shall now add such persuasive powers as I have to the persistence of the honorable member for Warringah, in the hope that we may. cause the Minister to reveal the exact basis of the '20 per cent, proposal - if one exists, which I doubt. I believe that an analytical examination of the whole subject might show that some beneficiaries under this bill should, in fact, obtain an increase of 50 per cent, in their pensions, whilst others may obtain an increase of only 20 per cent. Others may get nothing out of this repatriation bill. I insist, however, that a comparison of the rates of service pay in the last war and in this one may properly be made in considering the rates of pension - that should be provided. Pensions- of all kinds always bear some relation to the wages and salaries enjoyed by the persons to whom they are to be granted. 

I point out, also, that the attitude of the nation towards social welfare has improved tremendously since 1920. Early in 1920, the rate of invalid and old-age pensions was 12s. 6d. a week, though when the rates of war pensions were fixed in that year, invalid and old-age pensions had increased to 15s. a week. The rate of such pensions to-day is 26s. a week, and shortly it will be increased to 26s. 6d. Since 1920, child endowment and widows' pensions  have  been provided, and I hardly need to remind honorable members that only this week the Parliament has finally passed a bill to hypothecate an amount variously estimated up to £30,000,000 per annum for social services. I have no quarrel with these improvements. During the twelve years I have been a member of this Parliament I have consistently supported measures for the improvement of social conditions, and while I held ministerial office I had the honour to introduce measures to liberalize certain benefits of this nature. Seeing that civilians are benefiting so substantially from the improved outlook of the nation in this regard, surely 'the men and women who have served the nation at the battle-front, and those who depend upon them, should be given the best assistance that the nation can give them. 'Some reasons can no doubt be advanced against an arbitrary increase of the rate of war pensions by 50 per cent.; but such reasons as I have heard have not influenced me greatly. In fact, the reasons given by honorable members for opposing this proposal have been most inconsistent and illogical. I have been amazed to hear some honorable members argue that the nation cannot afford such an increase. As the honorable member for Reid  **(Mr. Morgan)**  is always, and sincerely, in the forefront of movements for social reform, I was astonished to hear him make such a statement.- Already this afternoon we have been told that the increase of the pension by 20 per .cent, will involve an annual charge on the Treasury of £1,600,000. If that statement is correct - the basis of it is the report of the special committee, supported by the secondreading speech of the Minister, and we accept it - it is a matter of simple arithmetic to calculate that the addition of 30 per cent, to the 20 per cent, would mean a further charge on the Treasury of £2,400,000. It is true that, as the war proceeds, the number of pensions payable will increase. That, however, would not alter the differential as between the 20 per cent, and the 50 per cent. There is on the notice-paper of this House legislation designed to improve the maternity benefits. Speaking to that bill, the Minister stated that the cost of the extra benefits will be approximately £2,000,000, which is nearly as much as we ask, shall be added to the pensions of returned soldiers. Did honorable members tremble when they were told that the extra cost of the maternity benefits under the proposal of the Government would amount to that figure? Not a bit. That proposal, I hope, will be passed through this Parliament without dissent. I intend to support it. Whatever other reasons may be advanced against more liberal treatment of the returned soldiers and their dependants, I cannot understand the argument of inability to pay. We listened early this afternoon to a lengthy statement by the Attorney-General, setting out the factors which operate when the Government is determining what compensation shall be paid to civilians who are asked to surrender to the Commonwealth their goods or property. The right honorable gentleman went into very great detail; indeed, he apologized for the length of the statement. Did he mention once that a factor which influences the Government in the determination of the compensation that shall be payable is the ability of the Treasury to meet it? Not one word in that strain, and rightly so. If the ability of the Treasury to meet the cost is not a factor to be taken into consideration when Australians are surrendering goods or property, surely we should not make it a factor when women are surrendering their husbands; children, their fathers, and soldiers their lives. 


 **Mr. POLLARD** (Ballarat) [4.13J.- For the reasons which I gave when I made my second-reading speech, I support the proposed increase of 20 per cent. Quite a number of speeches have since been delivered, some of them in advocacy of the increase of 50 per cent., which the amendment of the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  proposes. The honorable member for , 

Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald), Senator Collett,**  and the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis),**  probably had more distinguished military records than had the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison).**  The view that they have expounded in their support of an increase of 20 per cent, is eminently sound. The honorable member for Moreton and  **Senator Collett**  have been Ministers for Repatriation. There were frequent agitations for increases of pensions during the regime of governments supported by the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart).**  I vividly recollect the occasion when, from the benches opposite, I urged that an increase should be granted, in view of the lowering of the purchasing power of money compared with what it was when the pensions were fixed. The honorable member for Wentworth, who was either Minister for Repatriation or at all events a supporter of the then Government, remained quite unmoved. I do not believe that he gave the slightest indication of being interested in the matter, notwithstanding the fact that there had been a distinct upward move of the cost of living and that the purchasing power of money had depreciated materially. When one hears the honorable member characteristically assert that the increase ought to be 50 per cent., one wonders whether he has ever been or ever will be consistent, and whether he is merely playing to the gallery. There is one feature of his speech to which some attention should he paid. As usual, he introduced a story concerning a group of men in a certain city factory who, according to him, are earning extraordinarily high rates of pay. He did not elaborate the reasons for their high earnings. 

##### Mr Harrison:

-- I said that they are in a munitions establishment. 

##### Mr POLLARD:<br><small class="text-muted">BALLAARAT, VICTORIA</small>

-- The honorable gentleman omitted to state that high wages are earned by men not only in munitions establishments, 'but also in every other walk of life. Members of Parliament earn substantial incomes. Why should he always stigmatize the munitions workers? If they are earning extraordinarily high wages - which I deny - the reason is that early in the war t the Government of which the honorable gentleman was a member acknowledged its adherence to the continuance of Australian rates for civilian workers during the war. Does the honorable gentleman wish to depart from that policy ? Does he say that all our industrial awards should be scrapped and that we should cease to allow munitions workers to earn overtime rates during long hours of fatiguing work? Does he realize that munitions workers, members of Parliament, and business men are the fathers, sons, daughters and relatives of the fighting  *men*  whose welfare we are now considering ? The returned soldier is the last man who would want to reduce the standard of the men in the industrial field because he knows full well that, if the income of the munitions worker - and, perhaps, the member of Parliament - is reduced, he will be due for a reduction of his standard when he returns to a civil avocation. The only way in which equity may be achieved in the payment of men who are in the forces and in civil employment is to ration every body, including the honorable member for Wentworth. 

##### Mr Harrison:

-- I would have every industrialist and soldier on the same wage. 

##### The CHAIRMAN (Mr Prowse:<br><small class="text-muted">FORREST, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>



Order ! I remind the honorable member for Wentworth that the Chair has certain feelings and a limited endurance. It does not propose to endure the honorable member much longer. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- This feature of the honorable member's speech should be examined along the lines I have indicated, and should be exposed. He is aware that, in the group which he has mentioned, there may he returned soldiers of the last war, doing splendid service in a civil capacity. Does he desire that they should not be recompensed for the .additional exhaustion that is caused by their service during long hours in the factory? I hope that he does not; but  His  speech would indicate that he does. The honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  and others have asked upon what scientific basis the committee recommended an increase of 20 per cent. I ask the honorable member what is the scientific basis of reward which enables a man with the necessary capital to buy a parcel of shares on the stock exchange and, if he is lucky enough to experience a rise of prices, to sell out and live in comfort for the rest of his life on the proceeds? What is the scientific basis of reward that enables a pugilist to earn a prize of £10,000 in the ring in a few minutes, perhaps? 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The honorable member's comparisons are rather wide of the mark. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- The scientist who renders valuable service to the community may die in a garret in poverty, whilst the pugilist earns enough in one bout to keep him in luxury for the rest of his life. What is the scientific basis ' for that? The answer is that those who serve the community are not rewarded according to any scientific formula. However, the committee did ask itself what factors it should take into consideration in arriving at a just estimate of the pension rate. It did compare the purchasing value of money in 1914-1S with that of the present time, and it found that the value of money had declined by 12 per cent. However, the committee did not recommend a 12 per cent, increase of pensions, because* it recognized that other factors were involved, and so it arrived at a figure of 20 per cent. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  It allowed S per cent, for all the other factors? 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- The honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  should not insist upon a too scientific valuation of services. If he were briefed in a law case he might, if the judge were in a favorable mood, win a verdict for his client for £20,000, and draw a fee for himself of £5,000. We also took into consideration the fact - and this weighed with soldiers' organizations, too - that S7 per cent, of pensionable men are, as members of the community, earning incomes as great as they are capable of earning. Other factors were taken into consideration, but I do not think that I ought to reveal them to the honorable member for Wentworth, the honorable member for Warringah, and others. Both the honorable member for Wentworth and the honorable member for Parramatta made great play on the fact that the Government had introduced a scheme of social welfare which was to cost £30,000,000 a year. However, they did not point out that the returned soldiers, and their wives and children, would themselves be beneficiaries under that scheme. The honorable member for Parramatta referred to increased maternity benefits. I ask him, will not the wives of soldiers share in that benefit also? In the circumstances, how can we take any notice of the senseless prattle of the honorable member for Wentworth ? I congratulate the honorable member for Lilley  **(Mr. Jolly)**  on the common-sense views which he expressed. He has six sons in the fighting forces, and he, if any one, should be concerned for the welfare of the soldiers. The fact that he supports the Government's proposal indicates that it is essentially fair. The honorable member for Robertson  **(Mr. Spooner)**  also took a common-sense view of the matter. For my part, I am in favour of an increase of 50 per cent, or 60 per cent., or 70 per cent., or .any old percentage you like, 'but one cannot overlook the fact that it is necessary to preserve some relation between benefits to soldiers and benefits to members of the civil community. I hope that this clause will be agreed to, and that the 20 per cent, increase will be maintained. There is nothing to prevent the standing committee on repatriation, when it is appointed, to inquire into the matter further, at the request of the Minister, or the Repatriation Commission, or the returned soldiers themselves. I trust that, whoever may' be appointed to that committee, it will examine all repatriation problems impartially, and in a non-party spirit. 

##### Mr McCALL:<br><small class="text-muted">Martin</small>

.- I rise to support the amendment of the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender),**  because I believe that a 50 per cent, increase is justified on the data before us. I have no hesitation in adding that the returned soldiers' organizations in my electorate have asked me to support this proposal. The honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard)**  said that there was no scientific basis for the proposed increase of 20 per cent. Those who support the amendment are glad to ha.ve that admission, because it strengthens their argument in favour of a 50 per cent, increase. The honorable  member said that all the members of the parliamentary committee on repatriation were returned soldiers. That is as it should be, but it does not justify the argument that the rate of 20 per cent is justified. This issue cannot be decided on personal matters concerning a man's war record. The honorable member for Ballarat cast a slur on the war record of the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison).** 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- I did nothing of the kind. I know the worth of the war record of the honorable member for Wentworth. 

##### Mr McCALL:

-- The honorable member for Wentworth had meritorious service. In any case, this matter should be argued on merit, not on emotion. I shall examine the basis on which the special committee recommended an increase of 20 per cent. The committee is to be congratulated on its report in every respect but one. The formidable document shows that the committee went to work with a will, in the interests of returned soldiers. That makes it all the more extraordinary that it should have recommended, without stating its reasons, an increase of 20 per cent. Under the heading of "Rate of Pension", the committee, in recommendation 24, said - 

  >Hie  committee found that there was reasonable ground for a general increase of the rates df war pension. An outstanding factor in this regard was the comparison of rates of pay to members of the forces, and allowances to their dependants with the same items in respect of the 1014 war. In the case of death of a member the rate of war pension in most cases is considerably below the payments received by the dependants, particularly widows with children, by way of members' allotment and dependants' allowances, up to the time of commencement of pension. 

If there were reasonable grounds for them arriving at that percentage, why did the committee not state them? It very effectively elaborated all its other recommendations. The honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  has un availlingly tried to elicit from the Minister for Repatriation the basis on which the increase of 20 per cent, was determined. Either the Minister would not give the information or there was none for him to give. We did elicit from the honorable member for Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald)**  that the figure of 20 per cent, was made up of 11.6 per cent, for the increase of the cost of living since 1920 and S.4 per cent, for all other factors. That is rather a loose way in which to deal with such an important matter - S.4 per cent, for " all other factors"! Any one supporting- the amendment should give his reasons for doing so. We have agreed to 50 per cent, because we think that it is justified by all the circumstances. Opponents of the amendment have emphasized the fact that the committee which recommended the increase of 20 per cent, consisted entirely of returned soldiers, and asked who were better qualified than returned soldiers to judge the requirements of returned soldiers. The New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia advocates an increase of 50 per cent. It has been belatedly disclosed that the Victorian branch advocates an increase of 41.6 per cent., that rate being equivalent to the percentage by which soldiers' pay has been increased since the last war. What happens now to the argument of those honorable, members who say that no one is better qualified than the special committee to say what, in fairness, should be given to the returned soldiers? The New South Wales and the Victorian branches would account for about 70 per cent, of the total membership of the league in Australia. That alone would justify me in supporting an amendment designed to increase the rate of pension by 50 per cent. I, however, do not rest my case on that consideration. The weighted average of adult wages has increased by 40 per cent, since 1920. I think the cost of living has increased in the same period by 11 per cent. The honorable member for Wentworth, in his admirable speech, demonstrated how the national income has grown from £537,000,000 in 1935 to more than £1,000,000,000 now. That is an increase of 100 per cent. Surely then, we are justified even in erring on the side of generosity to the men who have defended and are defending Australia." If the amendment to increase the pension by 50 per cent, is defeated, I shall support an amendment to increase it by 33--V per cent., or any amendment to increase the pension by any proportion above 20 per cent. In 1920 invalid and old-age pensions amounted to £39 a year; they are now £67 12s., an increase of 70 per cent. How then can the 'Government try to justify increasing the pension of returned soldiers by only 20 per cent. 

##### Mr Francis:

--  By how much has the cost of living increased? 

##### Mr McCALL:

-- By 11 per cent. But this matter cannot be determined only on the basis of the cost of living, because the productive capacity of this country has been greatly increased. Consideration has been paid by the Arbitration Court, in determining the basic wage, to the increased wealth of the country. The returned soldiers, particularly those who are incapacitated, are equally entitled to share in the increased wealth of the country. Some honorable members have declared that an increase of the rate of pension to 50 per cent, would necessitate the introduction of a " means test ". That would not be necessary. air Frederick Stewart.  -  I cannot see the connexion. 

##### Mr McCALL:

-- Neither can I. I am opposed to any such suggestion. One of the most "important factors to be taken into consideration when fixing an arbitrary rate is the purchasing power of money. One must anticipate a considerable depreciation of the purchasing power of the £1. Therefore, honorable members should err, if at all, on the side of generosity. But regardless of how they vote on this issue I give honorable members credit for advocating what they honestly believe to be correct. I do not impute to them political motives; and I am confident that the committee will ensure that the soldiers will receive equitable treatment. 


 **Sir CHARLES** MARR (Parkes; [4.42]. - I have listened not so much with interest as with amazement to the discussion of this amendment. Most of the opposition to it emanates from honorable members who represent States other than New South Wales. They attacked representatives of New South Wales instead of discussing the merits of the amendment, and loud-mouthed interjectors from South Australia complained that the country could not afford a substantially increased pensions bill. During the debate on the motion for the second reading of the bill, I made some very temperate remarks, and I deplore the fact that repatriation seems to be becoming a political dog-fight. 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

--  The honorable member is protesting too much ! 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I have heard a good deal about " industrial fatigue ". God help this country if we depended upon some of our industrialists to win the war ! 

##### Mr Frost:

--  And God help this country if we did not have the industrialists. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- The country would be better off if the industrialists worked harder than they are doing, instead of going on strike. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  We always hear this. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- One-half of the present number of factory operatives could produce the present output of war materials if they did not loaf during the day in order to work overtime at night. 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

--  That is a cowardly reflection on the industrialists. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I can prove that statement. 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

--  The honorable member is living in a coward's castle. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- These men receive high wages and enjoy good working conditions, but their safety depends entirely on the troops who are offering their lives to defend Australia. Australia could not hope to throw back the enemy if our troops were not prepared to fight for us on the battle-field. No industrialist suffers fatigue commensurate with the sufferings of our troops in the malaria-infested marshes of New Guinea. It is time that the soldiers formed a union for the purpose of fighting for their rights. Where would we be if they laid down their implements of war and refused to fight until they were given week-end leave, and paid double rates for Sunday? The soldiers should " wake up " to this matter. After the war, they should fight for -improved conditions. 

##### Mr Morgan:

--  That is an incitement to civil war. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I want to see the soldiers govern this country after the  war. Having fought for us, they have every right to fight for the peace, in the parliaments of this country. 

##### Mr Morgan:

-- "We are supposed to be fighting for constitutional government. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- It would be better if all of us donned uniform instead of fighting in this atmosphere. Those who are not members of the fighting forces should have the same pay and conditions of employment as the troops. The man in a " sheltered " industry is sufficiently safeguarded from danger through being so employed. For months, industrialists have earned as much as £60 a week. Cooks have earned £30 a week. It is a pity that there are not a few more cooks in the Army, to prepare food for the soldiers. 

##### Mr Conelan:

-- That is unfair. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- It is unfair not to grant increased allowances to the widows and dependants of soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for this country. 

##### Mr McLEOD:<br><small class="text-muted">WANNON, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- When was the honorable member Minister for Repatriation? 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I was Minister for Repatriation immediately after the depression, and I restored the rates to the figure ruling before the Scullin Government reduced them. I should make it clear that I do not blame the Scullin Government for reducing wages, salaries and pensions in order to achieve budgetary equilibrium. But on the advice of the late  **Mr. Coleman**  and myself, the then Prime Minister  **(Mr. Scullin)**  and the then Treasurer  **(Mr. Theodore)**  met a deputation of returned soldiers and explained why pensions had to be reduced. I give them Credit for granting that interview to the returned soldiers. I make no complaint about the action of the Scullin Government in reducing the pensions. The Labour party was unfortunate in having to take office during the depression. 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

-- The depression was caused by the Bruce-Page Government. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- The Minister pays too big a compliment to the influence of the Bruce-Page Government if he considers that it was responsible for the world-wide depression. 

##### Mr McLeod:

-- If a United Australia party government happens to be in office at the beginning of the next depression, will the honorable member use the same argument? 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- It is unfair to state that a United Australia party government was responsible for the depression. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- Order ! I ask the honorable member to address his remarks to the clause. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- Australia did not create the world-wide depression. In fact Australia was one of the last countries to feel the effects of the depression. 

##### Mr McLeod:

-- The depression was unnecessary in this country. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I was Minister for Repatriation after the depression, but I claim no particular credit for having restored the rate of pensions. Honorable members object to the present proposal for increasing the rate by 50 per cent, on the ground that the country cannot afford the additional expenditure. Honorable members on this side of the committee are often accused of arguing that the time is not opportune to incur proposed expenditure.. It appears that many honorable gentlemen opposite are employing that argument at the moment. 

##### Mr Frost:

-- Pensions are being increased substantially; they are not being left at the old rates. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I agree with the Minister, and I have given him and the Government full marks for this bill. I do not abuse honorable gentlemen whose views are different from mine on this issue; but I ask them to advance some arguments in support of their case. The best reason so far given for the 20 per cent, increase is that the cost of living has increased by only 11 per cent, since 1920. In view of many other considerations, I do not consider that -that is a strong argument. I point out that the rates of pay of soldiers are 41 per cent, higher in this war than they were in the last war. It can be taken for granted that the increases of pay have been given for good reasons. One such reason is that civilian workers are enjoying much higher pay than are members of the fighting 'services. That is a substantial ground for increasing war pensions by  50 per cent. One honorable member, in supporting the proposal for a 50 per cent, increase, pointed out that if a married man lost his life while engaged in industry his widow received a lump sum payment of £800, a pension of £3 a week for herself, and a pension in respect of each child dependent upon her. Surely in a democracy we should be at least as generous to the dependants of those who are fighting so desperately to maintain our way of life. It  i3  of no use to talk to me about the good work being done by men and women engaged in war industries. 

##### Mr Pollard:

--  They are doing good work. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I agree with the honorable member; but their service and sacrifices are not to be compared with those of the members of the fighting services. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  The fighting services could not be maintained without the workers on the industrial front. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- There is a tendency to over-emphasise the importance of the work done in our war industries. Of what use would such work be if we had no heroes to fight for us? 

##### Mr Coles:

--  And vice versa. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- Why should we favour industrial workers in preference to members of the fighting services ? Industrial workers are not subjected to anything like the same dangers and hazards as are members of the fighting services. If I had my way I would put all the wharf-labourers who handle cargo for war purposes on the same rates of pay as soldiers. In fact, I would put members of Parliament, and all other people, on similar rates of pay. In our fight for democracy, there should be equality of sacrifice. We should not expect the members of the fighting services to make all the sacrifices. 

##### Mr Pollard:

--  The honorable member will find that many men who served in the last war hold different views from those which he is now expressing. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- The honorable member for Ballarat is a returned soldier from the last war and, as the  chairman  of the special committee which considered this bill, he did valuable work. I should like him to understand that I am not criticizing the bill destructively. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The honorable member has exhausted his time, but if no other honorable member wishes to speak he may take his second period now. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- For reasons which I have already given, I consider that the rates of pensions should be increased by 50 per cent. Such an increase would bring the rates into conformity, in some degree, with present-day conditions. I am particularly concerned about the position of war widows with children to maintain. We should do everything in our power to afford them the maximum assistance of which the country is capable. I support the amendment, and I hope that the Government will accept it. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

.- The honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  has moved that the pensions payable to ex-soldiers and their dependants should be increased by a flat rate of 50 per cent, whereas the committee of returned soldier members of the Parliament which considered this bill recommended an increase of 20 per cent. Before proceeding to discuss that issue I wish briefly to appeal again to the Minister to liberalize the payments to widows and orphan children of soldiers. In my second-reading speech I compared the family income of the wife of a man absent with the fighting forces who had three children to provide for, with that of the widow of a soldier who also had three children dependent upon her. I indicated that the wife was 14s. a week better off, even under the recommendations of the committee, than was the widow with three children whose husband had made the supreme sacrifice. After his return to this country the husband may be able to re-establish himself in industry and to increase the family income substantially, but the unfortunate widow is not likely to be able to add much to her income. She will have a full-time job in maintaining a home for her orphan children and will have to depend upon her pension. I suggest to the Minister that, instead of the £2 10s. recommended  by the committee of which I was a member - I take full responsibility for the recommendation ; my object is to serve the returned soldiers and not to rely on formalities - the payment to the widow should be £2 15s., and that the proposed payment of 12s. 6d. to each of three children should be raised to 15s. 6d. That would increase the total payment to £5 ls. 6d. a week, which would equal the amount received by the wife while her husband was in the service. 

##### Sir Frederick Stewart:

-- In other words, she should not suffer because her husband had died on active service. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- I do not wish to indulge in special pleading. I regret that the honorable gentleman has done so, too greatly. I intend to rely on facts. 

##### Sir Frederick Stewart:

-- The honorable gentleman is trying to save face. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- Of the amount of 14s., the wife should have 5s., and 3s. should go to each child. 

As to whether the increase of soldiers' pension rates should be 50 per cent, or 20 per cent., I say at the outset that no sum would be adequate to compensate a man for war disabilities, or a widow with children for the loss of her husband and bread-winner. I attack the second point of the argument of my friends who are opposed to the increase of 20 per cent. Because high wages are paid to employees of the Civil Constructional Corps, or in secondary industries or munitions establishments, we should not on that account " go mad ". It is quite wrong to argue that because a worker in a particular factory is receiving a lot of money we should not have regard to what would be just and generous to the returned soldiers. We have listened to speeches by the honorable members for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender),**  Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison),**  Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr),**  Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart),**  and Martin  **(Mr.**  McCall).  All of those gentlemen spoke of the representations for a 50 per cent, increase having been made in New South Wales. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- I did not. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- The honorable member for Parkes said that the proposal that the increase should be 50 per cent, had been advanced on a representation from New South Wales. I maintain that tue representation originated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour. The remainder of New South Wales, with its large number of members in this House is, so far as one can ascertain, on the side of the recommendations of the special committee. 

##### Mr Collins:

-- In that statement, the honorable gentleman is a long way out 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- I ask the committee to consider the record of the right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes),**  who is known as " the little Digger " and is the idol of the returned soldiers. I invite it to compare the services rendered to returned soldiers throughout the last war and since by the right honorable member with those rendered by the honorable member for Warringah. Would the right honorable gentleman, -who has given a life-time of service to returned soldiers, turn them down on this matter? 

##### Mr Spender:

-- Does that mean that no one of this generation may express an opinion? 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- The right honorable member for North Sydney, I repeat, has given a life- time of service to the returned soldiers, and no man is held by them in higher esteem. He would not do any injury to them ; to prevent it, he would give his life. He has not hesitated to stand by the recommendation of the committee after a .thorough examination of it. 

Let us analyse what we have heard from the honorable member for Warringah. He has stated that, as far back as the 23rd July, 1941, he wrote to the then government, of which he was a member, asking that the pension should be increased by 50 per cent. So far as this Parliament is aware, nothing happened in that respect. Between June and July of last year, every member of this Parliament was written to by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Repatriation and asked to make any representations or recommendations' he might care to offer as to what might be done to improve the Repatriation Act in the light of the existing circumstances. The honorable member for Warringah had an opportunity to make representations for an increase of 50 per cent., but he did not do so. No reply at all was received from him. I am perfectly satisfied that, had the right honorable member for North Sydney considered in July, 1941, that the pension should be increased by 50 per cent., he would not have waited until to-day, but would have pulled this building down and " raised hell " to have the increase made. I regret the necessity to speak in this strain; but I have sat for three or four days under one-sided criticism, and do not intend to take any more of it. I want to make it quite clear that my record of service to returned soldiers will bear comparison with that of the honorable member for "Warringah. When I entered this Parliament, I was an original member of the State managing council of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, in Queensland. I had been district  president  in my district for three years, and  president  in my own town for more than three years. I should not ask returned soldiers to accept an increase of 20 per cent, if T considered that a higher increase would be proper. Urged by returned soldiers I came into this Parliament in order to serve my former comrades of the Australian Imperial Force. I have been a member of it for about twenty years. At the date of my election, I was receiving a 50 per cent, pension. I have not since collected one shilling of it. Having entered this House to serve particularly returned soldiers, I would not collect any pension, because, if I did so, every effort I made to assist the soldiers and their dependants would benefit me also. By not collecting; my pension, I consider myself free to leave no stone unturned to improve the conditions of my old comrades and their dependants. That may be proved by a letter which I wrote to the Repatriation Department on the day on which I entered Parliament; the letter is still on the file. The pension that I received while  president  of the league, I handed to the Distressed Soldiers' Fund. With that record, why should I now debate whether the increase should be 20 per cent, or 50 per cent.? This Parliament asked six returned soldiers to examine the matter. They went through the act and regulations, and discussed the matter from many angles for a considerable time. One of the many decisions at which they arrived was that to-day there is more money in the hands of the people, despite heavy taxation, than there has been previously. We considered that, accordingly, the pension ought to be increased. The committee had then to consider the amount of the increase. An infallible rule cannot be laid down ; one has to inform one's mind of the facts. The committee sought the co-operation of the Commonwealth Statistician, and learned that between 1920 and 1942 the cost of living had been reduced by 5 per cent. It would not recommend that pensions should be reduced correspondingly. ' The next factor considered was the basic wage, which was found to have been increased by 11.7 per cent. The committee held the view that an increase of pensions by 11.7 per cent, would not, be fair. Every member of it considered that the best fighting force in the world should receive the highest pension that could be recommended. We had to base our recommendation upon sound principles. We considered how much costs had risen between September, 1939, and September, 1942. We found that the cost of living had increased by 20.7 per cent., and the basic wage by 20 per cent. Those figures gave us an indication of what the increase should be. We spent more time considering .this matter than any other part of the report, except the question of eligibility. We were on the job almost clay and night for 28 days. Every factor was carefully examined, and we eventually came to the conclusion that a 20 per cent,, general increase would be the proper thing. We recommended an increase of 25 per cent, for widows, and one of 66J per cent, for orphans, and I am prepared to go still higher on that. I am sorry to have to say - and it is not party politics, but a simple fact - that there is a drift towards inflation at the present time. I am convinced that the Government is doing things which it should not do; that it is leaving undone things which it should do, and that its actions in this regard are accentuating the drift towards inflation. I am fully alive to that danger, and have put forward proposals to combat it. I have suggested that the members of the joint parliamentary committee on repatriation, who are soaked in the subject, and whose recommendations have been largely, accepted by the Government, should review these matters from time to time. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The honorable member's time has expired, but if no other honorable member wishes to speak, Iia may take his second period now. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- All the returned soldiers' organizations of New South Wales, with the exceptions stated, have supported the proposed increase of 20 per cent. Had this bill been considered immediately after the parliamentary committee had brought in its report, the committee would have been applauded for what it had done, and the bill would have been accepted. Unfortunately, there has been a delay of six months, and the letter written by the honorable member for Warringah on the 23rd July, 1941, has been resurrected. There is also the request from New South Wales for a greater increase. However, New South Wales is not Australia, though it is a very important part of it. As a matter of fact, all the representatives of New South Wales in this House, except the five who represent electorates around Sydney Harbour, are prepared to accept something less than 50 per cent. 

Last night, the Minister for Repatriation replied to the second-reading debate on this bill. I appreciate that he could not answer every point raised, but 1 regret that he made no substantial reference to the subject of widows' pensions, and that he did not answer the strong plea of honorable members on this side of the House on the subject of preference to returned soldiers. I regard that as vital, and I hope that we shall have no equivocation on the matter. During the second-reading debate, I suggested that applicants should be reimbursed, if successful, for expenses incurred in carrying their appeals before tribunals. No soldier may appear a second time before the Repatriation Commission or a tribunal unless he has fresh, relevant evidence to present. In order to get fresh medical evidence, he must consult a specialist, and that costs money. The Minister did not refer to that point, and there is no provision for it in the bill. I have foreshadowed an amendment providing for a full pension for soldiers of both wars who served in a theatre of war and are now suffering from tuberculosis. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The honorable member may discuss that subject on the appropriate clause. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- The debate has shown clearly that the recommendation of the parliamentary committee for a 20 per cent, increase of the rates of pension was just. It has been accepted by the Government and by a great majority of honorable members as well as by almost all returned soldiers' organizations. Only a limited number is prepared to support the amendment asking for a 50 per cent, increase, and I am convinced that the best interests of returned soldiers are not served by pressing the amendment. Those who do that are, in fact, doing a disservice to the soldiers who will be thereby encouraged to hope that, some day, their pensions, will be further increased. Those who are supporting the amendment know that it cannot be carried, and I regret that it has been moved. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">Parkes</small>

-- The honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  said that I had informed honorable members that the proposal for an increase of the rates of pension by 50 pei1 cent, had been advanced on a representation by the New South Wales branch of the returned soldiers' organization. That is not so. At the beginning of my speech I said that, instead of the matter being discussed on its merits, there appeared to be an attack by honorable members from other parts of Australia on certain representatives from New South Wales. I resent this misconstruction of my remarks. The honorable member for Moreton begged the committee to support the recommendations of the special parliamentary committee on repatriation, yet he himself has given notice to-day of an amendment which will have the effect of varying one of the committee's recommendations. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

.- I have not spoken on this bill before, but I have heard the whole of the discussion on the proposal of the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender).**  I have a great deal of hesitation in voting against the recommendation  of the special committee,, because I think that that body has done a very fine piece of work, and I am particularly influenced by the arguments of my friend, the honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard).**  Notwithstanding that, I have made up my mind to join the band from New South Wales. In the first place, even the members of the committee do not consider themselves bound by the exact terms of their report, because the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  is himself the author of amendments proposing important deviations, which I think I shall support, from the recommendations of the committee. Therefore, no one is bound by the exact terms of the report. I have two points of view on this. The first is that I agree with what was said by the honorable member for Moreton about the inadequacy of the payments to widows and orphans. The honorable member himself suggested an amount for the widow with three children which would be more than a 50 per cent, increase of the pension which she now receives. The honorable member proposes that the amount paid to a widow with three children should he £5 12s. 6d. a week, but the committee recommended £5 ls. 6d. a week. The pension for a widow with three children is now £3 7s. a week; the bill proposes £4 7s. 6d. An increase of 33-J per cent, would give £4 19s. 4d., and of 50 per cent., £5 0s. 6d. The present rate for orphans is £1 17s. 6d. a week, and the bill proposes £2 5s. 6d. An increase of 33-J per cent, would give £2 10s., and of 50 per cent., £2 16s. 3d. Those sums do not seem at all disproportionate to the needs of widows and orphans. It is important to notice that the committee paid considerable attention to working out the rates for widows and orphans, but the honorable member for Moreton has now been convinced by the discussion that the committee made an inadequate provision for them, as I think it did. " 

##### Mr Francis:

-- Does the honorable member think that there is any section of people more worthy of consideration than the widows and orphans? 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- No ; but I remind the honorable member that he and the committee elaborately considered the needs of widows and orphans, and recommended for them an amount which is lower than that which the honorable member is now prepared to concede. My other point is that this represents what we may call the ceiling of social benefits. The benefits that are to be given to civilians under the National Welfare Fund Act will not in any way reach the amounts that will be given to the incapacitated soldiers and their dependants. In the words of the German proverb, "The tree will not reach the heavens ". If we fix low benefits for the injured soldiers and their dependants, then much lower benefits will be fixed for civilians and their dependants. We have an illustration of that in our legislation to-day. The allowance to the wife of an incapacitated member of the forces is to be increased from 18s. a  week  to £1 2s. In other legislation it is proposed that the wife of an invalid 'pensioner shall receive 15s. a week. I want to see as liberal a scheme of benefits as is possible given to the civilians, who will benefit under the national welfare scheme. I do not know what is to be given to them. The scheme so far is nebulous. But I am sure that, whatever we give to the soldiers and their dependants will be more than what we shall give to the civilians and their dependants. Therefore I want to ensure that the soldiers and their dependants shall be given as much as we can give to them, in order that civilians shall also receive further social justice. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:<br><small class="text-muted">Richmond</small>

.- A great deal of play has been made with figures in this discussion, and reasons have been adduced why the pensions should be increased by 50 per cent., or some other proportion. Some arguments have been based on the cost of living in 1920 as compared with 1942, others on the basic wage in 1922 as compared with 1942, and others on the general earnings of the community. Varying groups of figures could be cited according to the arguments that the different proponents wanted to support. What I am concerned with is the fact that this is a money bill, and therefore cannot be amended without the agreement of the Government and without being withdrawn. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- That is quite wrong. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:

-- The honorable member has moved for the postponement of the clause instead of directly moving for a straightout increase of the rate of pension by 50 per cent., as he can achieve his objective in no other way. The honorable member has moved for the postponement of one of the most vital clauses in the bill. Does that not amount to the postponement of the bill itself? The bill cannot operate if that particular clause does not operate. As one with the interests pf the returned soldiers at heart, I regard it as wrong to ask for the postponement of a bill which proposes benefits to people who are in very great need. I shall cite figures to show the benefit that will flow to a large number of individuals in this community immediately this bill becomes operative. The blinded soldier, with a wife and three children, receives £4 a week for himself, 18s. for his wife and £1 2s. 6d. for his children, and £1 attendant's allowance- a total of £7 0s. 6d. This bill proposes to raise the amount to £8 9s., an immediate benefit. The honorable member for Warringah, in order to put forward some specious amendment into which he has been propelled by certain organizations in and around Sydney, would ask for the postponement of that benefit, but I desire it to be given immediately. The totally and permanently incapacitated soldier, with a wife and three children, now receives £6 0s. 6d. a week. The bill provides that he shall receive £7 5s. a week, an increase of £1 4s. 6d. Honorable members may argue until they are black in the face whether the percentage should be based on the cost of living in 1914, 1920 or 1942 ; but what concerns the pensioners, who need the increase, is that they will receive the additional payment as soon as the bill becomes law. Therefore, this legislation should not be delayed. 

A soldier, 100 per cent, incapacitated and unable temporarily to engage in any occupation, with a wife and three children, now receives £5 2s. 6d. a week. When the bill becomes law, he will be paid £6 3s. a week. If the Government agrees to postpone the clause, the bill will be delayed and the increased benefits that this measure will confer, will be held up for a considerable period. I hope that the Minister will not accede to the request of the honorable member for Warringah. To ask honorable members to agree to the postponement of the bill is not to serve the interests of those who will benefit under the measure. 

I am not completely satisfied with all the recommendations of the parliamentary committee, and I contemplate submitting amendments to two clauses. However, I congratulate the committee on its fine work. No matter how the committee was constituted, other honorable members would still have found possible grounds for criticizing its recommendations. I find no fault with any of its proposals, but consideration could with advantage be given to one or two matters. I refer, in particular, to the financial position of a widow and her children. A wife with three children receives, when the husband is alive, allowances totalling £5 ls. 6d. a week. If he is killed, her allowances are immediately reduced to £3 7s. a week. When the bill becomes law, the amount will be increased to £4 7s. 6d. a week. Whilst I am in favour of that increase, I ask the Minister to consider, in the near future, the advisability of restoring to the widow and her family the income that she was paid when her husband was alive, so that his death will not involve her in any financial sacrifice. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">PARKES, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; NAT; UAP from 1931</small>

-- Why not submit the necessary amendment now? 

##### Mr ANTHONY:

-- The matter should be considered by the parliamentary committee. The bill makes a substantial advance by increasing the payment to the widow and her family by £1 a week. That amount is still inadequate, but I believe that the Government will consider increasing it. 

I have not spoken in favour of the amendment for increasing the rate of pension by 50 per cent, but I point out to the supporters of the amendment that some of the proposed allowances to children represent an increase of 66$ per cent. Figures can be manipulated to suit every argument, but what the pensioner will understand is that as soon as the bill is proclaimed, he will receive substantial additional payments. To him, that is the all-important thing. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">Barker &middot; ALP</small>

--  I did not participate in the debate on the motion for the second reading of the bill, because every honorable member was in agreement with it, and a prolongation of the discussion would have been neither necessary nor helpful. Now, however, the honorable member for "Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  has submitted an amendment to increase  the rates of pension by 50 per cent. I do not support it. The circumstances in which the amendment reached this chamber are, to say the least, unusual and they are not, to my mind at any rate, likely to redound to the general welfare of the returned soldiers. Certain representatives of the Sydney press, who met me more than once in Martin-place during the summer, were most interested, for some reason that they did not explain to me, in securing undertakings from members of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, to submit motions for very substantial increases of soldiers' pensions. I did not agree to give to the press any of my ideas regarding what should be done.  In my opinion, the Government has handled this matter with a great deal of acumen, which has not distinguished its treatment of certain other questions. 

##### Mr Paterson:

--  There is a sting in the tail of that compliment. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- The honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard)**  invited me, as he invited every other honorable member, to submit to the parliamentary committee recommendations for the improvement of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. In reply, I told the honorable member that I considered the committee was " a jolly good one ", and that I had perfect confidence that its members, all of whom came from different walks of life, would reach a conclusion fair to the returned soldier. The members of the committee were on the spot; they had every bit of evidence which could be gathered on the subject; and they had the opportunity to consider the evidence in detail. I think the committee did a good job. I deprecate the attempt that is now being made to indicate that certain honorable members on both sides of the chamber are not prepared to do all that should be done for returned soldiers. 

This amendment has been moved by the honorable  member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender).**  If my memory serves me correctly, the first intention was that it should be moved by the honorable member for Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr).** 

##### Mr Spender:

--  That is not so; the honorable member read that statement in the press. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- That may be so. Unfortunately, in this country, we are obliged to depend upon the press for a good deal of information that should reach us through other channels. We get very little information from some sources that should be freely open io us. If I have been misinformed on this point, so have other honorable members. The honorable member for Warringah has been a member of this Parliament for a number of years. I well remember his arrival here. Being an industrious person, I have examined the pages of  *Hansard,*  and they reveal to me that for some time the honorable gentleman was an independent member, but that later he became a member of the United Australia party, to which I belong at present. Subsequently he was a Minister. According to the  *Hansard*  index the speech the honorable gentleman delivered on this subject the other night was the first he has made on it in this Parliament. That is rather remarkable. 

As a member of the Menzies Govern-  ment the honorable member in July, 1941, felt moved to write a letter to the head of the Government of which he was such a distinguished member as the Minister for the Army recommending an increase of pensions by 50 per cent. I do not challenge the honorable gentleman's right to write such a letter, but I say that many circumstances in relation to army finances have altered since then. I was a member of the Government of which the honorable member for Warringah was Treasurer, and I say, too, that the honorable gentleman's attitude on financial questions now is a revelation to me. If he was satisfied that a 50 per cent, increase of pensions was justified in 1941, 1 cannot understand how he can be satisfied with such an increase now, seeing that both the cost of living and the remuneration of the troops have increased since then. 

I brush aside, therefore, any suggestion that there is value in the amendment that the honorable gentleman has moved. 

##### Mr Calwell:

--  These remarks are better suited to the party room. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- That is a matter for ourselves. There is one quality of which I shall not boast at present, but which I admit I hold and share to some degree with the honorable member for Melbourne  **(Mr. Calwell).**  It is a tendency to say things in this Parliament at times which may not suit some of my colleagues. The honorable member for Melbourne has distinguished himself in that regard on one or two recent occasions, but I do not know that he has quite collected the laurels. I make these observations in order to get in early. If I do not make them other honorable gentlemen may do so. 

The crux of this question in relation to the honorable member for "Warringah is that, having made the discovery in 1941 that pensions should be increased by 50 per cent., this is the first occasion on which he has found it advisable to say anything about it in Parliament. That fact will take a little explaining. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  I shall be able to explain it. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- I have no doubt that the honorable gentleman will be able to split a few silk threads, but talking is one thing and convincing the other fellow is another. I have not been convinced by the honorable gentleman, 

##### Mr Spender:

--  The honorable member is never convinced by any one who disagrees with him. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- My opinion would not be worth two pence if I could be convinced by people who disagreed with me. We are in this Parliament because we hold certain opinions. In the long run, however, we shall be judged by our records. Some of us could have made suggestions equally as florid as those made by the honorable member for Warringah had we been so minded; but I thank Heaven that we were not. Therefore, I stand with the Government on this issue. I also stand with the committee in which I have complete confidence. I stand, too, with the honorable member for Moreton (Mir. Francis) who is in charge of this debate on the Opposition side of the House. I compliment him on having just made what I believe to be one of the most effective speeches he has ever made in the Parliament. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

.- The honorable member for Richmond  **(Mr. Anthony)**  has summed up the position. He has said that if the amendment be carried the passage of the bill may be delayed and many people may be deprived, for some time, of the benefits which it provides. If a political crisis should occur during the period of postponement for further consideration it may happen that the measure will never be passed, and, therefore, many people would lose the benefits which the bill provides. Et is unfair to say that the benefits provided by the measure are limited to a 20 per cent, increase of pension rates. As the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  pointed out, the benefits in certain cases will amount to 66 per cent. I understand that the Government intends to accept certain amendments relating to the treatment of tubercular soldiers. If it does so, some people who draw pensions under this heading will receive an increase of their pensions by more than 100 per cent. 

I regret that the honorable member for Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr),**  perhaps inadvertently, and in the tension of debate, suggested that  members of the fighting services should return to Australia and fight for their rights. I do not think that that was a proper observation to make, particularly as our soldiers know that a government is in office which will treat them with full sympathy and will, itself, fight for their welfare. I remind honorable members that a parliamentary standing committee on repatriation is to be appointed, and that if need arises for a reconsideration of pension rates at any time that committee will give consideration to the subject. It will also be available to consider remedies for any anomalies that may be revealed. I suggest to the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  that when on any future occasion he is afforded the opportunity of submitting a case to the committee appointed to consider repatriation, he should accept it, for I assure him that any representations he may make will be sympathetically considered. 

##### Mr COLLINS:<br><small class="text-muted">Hume</small>

.- I have already expressed my appreciation of what has been done by both the Government and the special committee which was appointed for the purpose of preparing a report for submission to the Government. I very much regret the personalities that have been imported into the debate. It is deplorable to find some members charging others with insincerity in advancing what they consider might be of benefit to returned soldiers. The honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  has done what he considered was right, and the committee must applaud him for the presentation of his amendment, even though there' is no likelihood of its being accepted. The honorable members for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison)**  and Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart),**  and other honorable members, have supported it. The statement that it originated in " a little wayside village like Manly " does not carry any weight. Bo matter where it originated, it was taken up subsequently by the main body of returned soldiers in New South Wales, and was sponsored in the sub-branches throughout the State. Every sub-branch has wired its representative in this Parliament, to support whatever was recommended in the resolution that was carried by a gathering of New South Wales returned soldiers at a meeting held in the Sydney Town Hall. I have received a large pile of telegrams from subbranches in my electorate. I did not commit myself to support an increase of 50 per cent., because I had not seen the report - which had not then been released by the Government - or the provisions of the bill. When I did see them, I told the members of different subbranches that I favoured a substantial liberalization of the pensions, and considered that, an increase of 20 per cent, was inadequate. I still hold that view, and consider that more should be done. No amount of money can repay the returned men and their dependants for what they have done on behalf of the nation. Although the germs of tuberculosis may have been dormant in some men before they left Australia to fight abroad, the hardships and other conditions that they endured must have aggra vated their condition and have caused them later to become completely helpless. These men have given their service, whilst others have given their lives, leaving widows and children who are dependent on the nation for their support. The honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis),**  in an endeavour to force others to accept his idea, made a deplorable atttack on the honorable member for Warringah. I have already congratulated him on the excellence of the report of which he was a signatory, and the care which obviously was exercised in its preparation. But every member of this committee is not obliged to accept the recommendations of the special committee. Although we appreciate what it has done, we still have the right to express our opinions; otherwise, there would be no need for a parliament, because the business of government could be left to committees. The honorable member for Moreton endeavoured to draw comparisons between the services rendered to returned soldiers by the right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes)**  and the honorable member for Warringah. That was the most deplorable' spectacle ever witnessed in this chamber. All "of us know what the right honorable member for North Sydney has done for returned soldiers and the nation. He is not only respected, but also revered, by every returned soldier in the Commonwealth, as well as overseas, for what he did in the last war. He still loves all the returned men, and the nation which he then led, and would give his life, if need be, in their service, fighting for them to the last. That is- the spirit of the man who has been such an asset to this country. But 25 years ago he was in his heyday, whereas the honorable member for Warringah was hardly out of knickerbockers. Yet the honorable member for Moreton has attempted to draw a comparison between the two men, in order to induce honorable members to support his idea. I repeat that the proposed increase of 20 per cent, is totally inadequate; consequently, I shall vote for a higher rate. I, with the rest of the New South Wales candidates, favour the 50 per cent.; and if we cannot get that, we shall try to obtain an amount  between the two. We have the right to express our opinions, and shall do so. I shall support the amendment, which has been moved by the honorable member for Warringah in an attempt to prove his sincerity in this matter. Having been requested to do my utmost by so many sub-branches throughout the electorate that I have the honour to represent, as well as in other electorates, I shall stand by what my colleagues propose to do, even though I realize that the amendment will not be carried, because the Government is opposed to it, and has the support of many members on this side of the chamber. 

There is no more that I want to say. In spite of what the honorable member for Richmond  **(Mr. Anthony)**  has said, I do not believe that any honorable member wishes to delay the benefits which are proposed by the bill. The one point that I" want to make is, that we came to this .Parliament to express our opinions, and if that right is to be denied, we have no business to be here. 

##### Mr MCDONALD:<br><small class="text-muted">Corangamite</small>

. -I listened with interest to those honora'ble members who are supporting the amendment. I regret that the honorable member for Martin  **(Mr. McCall)**  is not in the chamber at the moment, because he had a good deal to say about the manner in which the special committee had arrived at the increase of 20 per cent, in the rates of pension. Obviously, he was not present yesterday, when the matter was debated at length by honorable members on both sides of the committee; otherwise, he would not have been in ignorance of the manner in which the computation had been made. Some pertinent questions have been addressed to the mover of the amendment, as to the way in which he had arrived at the decision that there should be an increase of 50 per cent. The honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron)**  has pointed out very well that, if in July, 1941, the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  believed that an increase of 50 per cent, was justified, and subsequently advocated in this chamber that the increase should be based on the rise of the cost of living and the basic wage, to-day he should, in order to be consistent, advocate an increase of at least 75. per cent. When, according to him, he was in favour of an increase of 50 per cent., the army pay was only 17 per cent, in excess of the amount that was paid during the last war. Therefore, if the honorable member wished to make the assessment on an army basis, he would need to propose an amount very Considerably in excess of what he has proposed. It has been said that there is no scientific principle which may be observed in approaching the consideration of this matter. Possibly that is correct. I notice that the honorable member for Martin is now present. I repeat for his benefit that we, as returned soldiers, have never said that pensions should be based on the cost of living. 

##### Mr McCall:

-- I did not say that the honorable member had done so. 

##### Mr MCDONALD:

-- I repeat for his special benefit that the returned soldiers have always advocated that the rate of pension should be commensurate with the disability sustained. The honorable member set out to show that the cost of living has increased by a certain percentage, and that the pension rate should. therefore, increase by the same proportion. 

##### Mr McCall:

-- There are many other factors, also. 

##### Mr MCDONALD:

-- The honorable, member's arguments were based entirely on the cost of living, and the basic wage. 1 point out that the returned soldiers have never asked that pensions be based on the cost of living or on the basic wage. As the honorable member for Lilley  **(Mr. Jolly)**  pointed out, returned soldiers and their families will enjoy the same social service benefits as will other members of the community. War pensions are something over and above what they are entitled  to as citizens. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- They are a disability  compensation. 

##### Mr MCDONALD:

-- That is so. If we approach the matter from that angle we shall have no difficulty in agreeing that an increase of 20 per cent, will do substantial justice to returned soldiers and their dependant:. I do not say that,  because the committee has made a certain recommendation, all honorable members are bound to accept it. Every one is entitled to express his opinions, and when I took exception to the remarks of the honorable member for Warringah it was because I believed that he was condemning the committee, not its recommendations. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  I condemned the committee's judgment. 

##### Mr McDONALD:

-- The honorable member's attitude may be summed up fairly well by saying that he appeared to appoint himself prosecuting counsel, judge and jury all in one. If we had been in the witness-box, the honorable member would probably have demanded that we answer his questions,  ye3  or no, and refrain from offering explanations. T believe that the provision in regard to the first child of a war widow might well be liberalized. I recognize that the bill embodies what our committee recommended, but since the report was made I have received much information which indicates that the proposed provision may operate harshly. However, if the Government answers that it has accepted the committee's recommendation, and cannot go beyond it, I shall support the Government's proposal. It must be remembered that the widow does not draw child endowment in respect of the first child. 

##### Mr Curtin:

--  -The honorable member is asking that the unendowed child of a soldier's widow, or the unendowed child of an incapacitated soldier's wife, should receive more than the committee recommended ? 

##### Mr McDONALD:

-- That is so. 

##### Mr Curtin:

--  I have not made a decision on the point; but I am impressed by what has been said. It must be remembered, however, that if the woman were drawing a widow's pension she would receive 5s. in respect of the child, though probably there would not be many such cases. Ordinarily, the unendowed child would represent an important element in the total family obligations. 

##### Mr MCDONALD:

-- I believe that, when the Prime Minister and the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  have had an opportunity to look further into the matter, they will agree that something should be done to enable the soldier's widow to collect as much each week as she did prior to the death of her husband. 

I remind honorable members that the Parliamentary Committee on Repatriation was not infallible, but it tackled its job with honesty and sincerity. I do not know of any other committee that worked more amicably than did ours, under the chairmanship of the honorable member for .Ballarat'  **(Mr. Pollard).**  We spent a busy and interesting time. We invited all members of Parliament to submit recommendations for the amendment of the Repatriation Act. I regret that those who are now advocating a 50 per cent, increase of the pensions rate did not seize the opportunity to make their representations then. Especially do I deplore the fact that the honorable member for Warringah, who, according to documentary evidence, held decided views on this subject nearly two years ago, should have refrained from accepting our invitation. We should certainly have considered his representations, even if we were not able to accept them. I hope that this bill will have a speedy passage through Parliament, because hundreds of thousands of people will be affected by it. It contains nothing of such a contentious nature that there is any reason for delaying it. If the Prime Minister and the Minister for Repatriation are prepared to deal fairly with the points which I have raised, the bill should give general satisfaction. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">New England</small>

-- I do not support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender).**  In my opinion, an increase of 50 per cent, of the pension rates would be far too much. Like many other honorable members, I received telegrams from returned soldiers' organizations in my electorate, and from branches outside my electorate. I also received a communication from the central New South Wales branch of the soldiers' league, of which Lieutenant Cutler, V.C., was secretary, asking me whether I was in favour of a 50 per cent, increase. I replied that I was in favour of a substantial increase, but I declined  to pin myself down to any particular figure. This discussion has not changed my attitude, as stated .by me last night. I do not think that it can be denied that the repatriation pensions were based originally on the rates of pay of Australian soldiers in the last war. The New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has pointed out that the rate of pay of soldiers in this war is 41.66 per cent, higher than in the last war. Although there must be a connexion between' the pay of serving soldiers and the pensions of repatriated soldiers, I do not know that pensions and pay should be increased in exactly the same ratio. A measure of justice would be given to returned soldiers if pensions were increased all round by 33^ per cent, and not 20 per cent., as is proposed in the bill. I would support an amendment designed to increase them by 33^ per cent. I deplore the low level to which this discussion has sunk. The war services of honorable members have been compared. My war services were lowly, but I tried to do my bit in serving for four and a quarter years in the front line. When personalities are indulged in not only from one side of the committee to the other but as between honorable members in the Opposition parties, it is no wonder that the people are beginning to hold Parliament and its members in contempt. My sensibilities were shocked when I heard one honorable member on this side of -the committee question the motives of the honorable member for Warringah'  **(Mr. Spender)**  and insinuate that he had moved for the postponement of this clause in order to prevent the repatriation bil] from becoming law during the present sessional period. I hope that the rest of the discussion will be at the high level which the subject deserves. 


 *Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m. [Quorum formed.~\* 


##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- I emphasize the necessity for preserving the purchasing power of war pensions by periodical  adjustments in order to meet the increasing cost of living. To achieve this objective, I shall move in committee the amendment that I forecast when speaking on the motion for the second reading of the bill, and I hope that the Government will accept it. 

##### Mr PERKINS:<br><small class="text-muted">Monaro &middot; Eden</small>

-- Last night I commended the Government upon its action in introducing this bill, but I intimated that I would support the proposal for increasing the rate of pension by 50 per cent. I realize that the Government will not agree to the amendment. If the committee accepted it, the Government, which has to provide the necessary finance, would probably withdraw the bill. I am committed to support the proposal, because, in my electorate, twenty sub-branches of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia have asked me to vote for it. Although I pointed out to them that a parliamentary com:mittee, consisting of returned soldiers, recommended an increase of 20 per cent., my experience of soldiers is that they are more severe on their own kind than ordinary citizens would be. 

I object to the tendency of certain honorable members to stigmatize as insincere other honorable members who advocate the increase of 50 per cent. I am sincere, and I have given my reasons for supporting the  proposal.  The honorable member  foi-  Warringah  **(Mr. Spender),**  in submitting his amendment, is just as sincere as are members of the returned soldiers' organizations. I shall vote in accordance with the wishes of my returned soldier constituents. At the same time, I realize that the Government will have to find hundreds of millions of pounds for purposes other than pensions and, therefore, it really rests with the Government to decide whether it will adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Warringah. I understand that" later an attempt may be made to adopt the Victorian proposal to increase the rate of pension, by 41 per cent, and, in that event, I shall support it. Surely we can vote calmly and dispassionately upon these issues, without being accused of insincerity when we wish to secure increased benefits for returned soldiers.

Clause 3-

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">Parkes</small>

-- I move - 

  >That the clause he postponed -  as an instruction to the Government -  that wherever in this bill the rates of pension payable under the principal act have not been increased by 33 per centum, they should be so increased. 

On the motion for the second reading of the bill, and later during the discussion of the amendment submitted by the honorable member forWarringah  **(Mr. Spender),**  I explained why I considered that the proposed increase of the rate of pension by 20 per cent was inadequate. I ask the committee to agree to the amendment. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- If this matter is approached dispassionately, no objection can be raised to the amendment. Whatever might have been said of the proposal to increase the rates of pension by 50 per cent., it cannot be applied to this amendment. The parliamentary committee admitted that the proposed increase of the rates of pension by 20 per cent. does not rest upon a scientific basis. Several factors were taken into consideration, but they appeared to be rather vague, and one factor was stressed at one period whilst a totally different factor was emphasized at another time. The honorable member for Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald)**  explained that 11.6 per cent. represented the increase in the cost of living factor, and that other factors were taken into consideration by the joint committee in determining the balance which made up the 20 per cent. I shall suggest three sound reasons for an increase of 33 per cent. The Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act 1920 was assented to on the 19th May, 1920, and I have taken for my starting , point the relevant statistical figure for December, 1919, and not December, 1920, for obvious reasons. The basic wage figure for December, 1919, was £3 16s. In September, 1942, it was £4 15s., a difference of 25 per cent. The nominal wage, otherwise known as the weighted average, was £3 14s.11d. in December, 1919 ; in September, 1942, it was £511s. 10d., the exact increase being 49 per cent. A further factor is that the increase in the soldiers' rates of pay is 41 per cent. It is obvious that we cannot find a precise formula to determine what the exact percentage of increase should be, but those three factors should assist the committee in coming to a reasoned conclusion. I do not wish to go into the matters dealt with by the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  this afternoon. The less we engage in personalities and odious comparisons in this matter, the better it will be for the measure and for the committee. I am concerned only with the merits of the amendment. In view of the three factors which I have given, no honorable member is justified in refusing to vote for it. There is no reason why we should accept any report which comes before this committee, if we are satisfied that it contains an error. With all due respect to the special parliamentary committee on repatriation, its error in this case is evident. I am not satisfied with any of the reasons given by its members although I do not challenge their bona fides. I know, that they are seeking to do their best for the soldiers, and I hope that I shall also be given credit for doing so. The three considerations that 1 have put forward should compel every honorable member who approaches this subject dispassionately to support the amendment. On the figures given, it involves about £800,000. In many other matters that have come before Parliament, with much less merit in them, we have cheerfully given away much larger sums. 

##### Mr RYAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Flinders</small>

.- It is evident that the committee is willing to grant a 20 per cent, increase of the rates of benefit, and is against the proposal for a 50 per cent, increase, but it is quite reasonable that the increase should be greater than the 20 per cent, which the special committee originally proposed. I was unconvinced by the assertion of the honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard)**  that 20 per cent, was a reasonable increase. When asked by interjection why he insisted on it as reasonable, he replied that some regard was paid by the joint committee to the increase of the basic wage, but the rest of the argument which he produced he kept more or less a secret to himself. Whilst it is difficult to lay clown a definite standard for adjusting the rates of benefit, certain factors ought to be taken into account. We should consider the following four most carefully before arriving at a decision : (1) The rates of pay and allowances to soldiers to-day as compared with the same items in respect of the 1914-1S war; (2) the standard of living .represented by the average wage sheet to-day as compared with the same thing in 1920; (3) the increased cost of living due to our present economic and financial situation ; and (4) the level of pensions that the country can be reasonably expected to bear, having regard to the large numbers who will go back to civil life after the end of the war. and also to the other burdens which the country will be called upon to bear in respect of reconstruction, including increased services to be brought into being at the end of the war. The joint committee based its 20 per cent, proposal on two factors - .first, a comparison between the rates of pay of the soldiers to-day and in 1914-18, and, secondly, the difference between the basic wage to-day and in 1920. If the committee's recommendation, made on the 14th September, was right then, it is wrong now, because the cost of living, and with it the basic wage, has materially altered since. From the 14th September to the 31st December last year the increase of the cost of living was 2.3 per cent. Since then the rate has gone up considerably, although the actual figure has not yet been notified by the Statistician, or published. The committee could not make the same recommendation to-day as it did in September last, but would have every justification for recommending an increase of at least 25 per cent. The honorable member for Warringah (M.r. Spender) and others have proposed an increase of 50 per cent., based on an entirely different set of factors, namely, the actual difference in the cost of living, combined with the difference in the nominal wage, now and in 1920, representing an increase of about 47 per cent,., together with the difference in the soldiers' rates of pay which is 41 per cent. They chose to make it 50 per cent., which on the whole is on the generous side. It is too high when related to the considerations that I have mentioned, and so I find myself unable to support it. After considering all the facts, I have come to the conclusion that the recommendation of the standing committee is too low, and ought to be raised, on to-day's figures, by at least 5 per cent., and, taking into account the other factors, by an additional 5 per cent., bringing it up to 30 per cent, or, in all the circumstances, the 33-Jf per cent, proposed by the honorable member for Parkes, whose amendment I therefore support. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- The Government does not, intend to accept the amendment. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  Has the Government considered it? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- Yes. This is not an auction block. Not only the Government, but also the standing committee, have given the subject every consideration. It was debated throughout the afternoon, and I do not wish to add anything more to what has been said, 

##### Mr Ryan:

--  Does the Government consider that no greater increase than 20 per cent, is justified in the present circumstances ? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- Yes. The honorable member now considers that 30 per cent, is justified. He has therefore raised his figure by 5 per cent. 

##### Mr Ryan:

--  I suggested 25 or 30 per cent. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- The honorable member first suggested 25 per cent. The Government is standing by the 20 per cent, recommended by the joint committee. Does the honorable member think that he is in a better position than the committee, which took every detail into consideration, to decide what the increase should be? 

##### Mr Ryan:

--  The committee reported five months ago. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- That makes no difference. The committee made its report, and stands by it. This is not a subject for auctioning in order to gain a small percentage just because the cost of living has gone up a little in the last month or so. It may fall again. What we decide now will be the law for many years. The rate of pension fixed in 1920 has hardly been altered since then, and the figure which we decide on now may not be altered before 1963. 

##### Mr JOLLY:<br><small class="text-muted">Lilley</small>

.- Whatever justification be offered for some increase on the recommendation of the special committee which has been accepted by the Government and included in the bill, the matter calls for calm consideration and much closer examination than it is possible to give to it in this chamber. The honorable ' member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender),**  who submitted certain information, will acknowledge that honorable members are entitled to an opportunity to satisfy themselves that it is correct. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  I got it from the honorable member for Corangamite, who is a -member of the special committee. 

##### Mr JOLLY:

-- I am not disputing it. I think that the honorable member said that the committee's basis was unscientific, but I suggest that it is rather unscientific to support a proposal to increase the recommendation of the committee from 20 per cent, to 50 per cent., and then to begin to make stabs at other percentages,  lt  is rather undignified for us to deal with this very important matter in this way. I understand that the Government has stated that it proposes to constitute the special committee as a standing committee on a permanent basis. Honorable members would be well advised to accept the recommendations of the special committee, leaving to the standing committee consideration of the whole of the facts and whatever recommendations it may deem fit to make on the material placed before it. The matter is too serious for us to accept any proposition without further research and a closer examination than can be made during this debate. 

##### Mr BARNARD:<br><small class="text-muted">Bass</small>

.- I support what has been proposed by the honorable member for Lilley  **(Mr. Jolly),**  which, so far as I can see, is the soundest proposition that has been made. At the moment, I am unreservedly in favour of the increase of 20 per cent, recommended by the special committee. It has been pointed out very ably by members on both sides of this committee that the investigation of that body was thorough and complete in every respect. To amend in any way what is proposed would be merely to make a s,tab in the dark. I do not impute improper motives to honorable members who suggest alterations ; they have their reasons for doing so. The  Government  has accepted the proposal for the appointment of a standing committee, and the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  intends to make provision for it in this measure; consequently, there will be no excuse for a thorough and efficient examination not being made of any matter that is related to repatriation and the welfare of the returned men and women who will come under the provisions of this legislation. We ought to leave the matter as it is - increase the pension by 20 per cent, as has been recommended, and let the standing committee make another investigation and submit a further recommendation if that be considered desirable. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

. I am glad that the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  is present, because I . desire to address an appeal to him. The Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  has stated that the Government proposes that the amendment that has been moved shall be rejected. I respectfully inform the right honorable gentleman that last night honorable members on this side endeavoured to induce the Minister to state the basis which, in his view, had been adopted in arriving at the increase of 20 per cent. That information has not been vouchsafed .to the committee. It is not for the committee blindly to accept the report of any body. There has been a full discussion on this matter. The three members of the special committee appointed from this chamber have expressed views as to how the 20 per cent, had been computed. Surely we have sufficient intelligence and judgment to determine whether or not that is sufficient! All that we desire is that not only just but also generous treatment shall be given to the returned soldiers. In view of the figures that I have given to the committee, I should like to know why at least 33 per cent, cannot be considered reasonable. Although I proposed that the increase should be 50 per cent., I am not now inconsistent in supporting an increase of 33 per cent., because, if the major proposition were correct, obviously the minor proposition also must be justified. The major having been rejected, I can still with conviction support the minor. Compared with five months prior to the passage of the original act, by September of last year the basic wage had increased by 25 per cent.; the weighted average wage by 49 per cent. ; and - the outstanding fact referred to in the report of the committee - rates of pay by 41 per cent. Do not those figures afford complete justification for an increase of the pension rates by 33 per cent.? I cannot understand the attitude of the committee to this matter. The Minister protects himself behind the report of the special committee, and reads what is supplied to him by the Repatriation Department. I ask him now to state why, in the light of the three facts that I have given, the Government will not agree to the increase of 33 per cent. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:<br><small class="text-muted">Dalley</small>

.- We are witnessing from a certain section of the Opposition - the most inactive section when the special committee was engaged upon its task - a disgusting exhibition of a "Dutch auction ", in which they have demonstrated with great clarity to their own minds, that nothing less than an increase of 50 per cent, can be justified. Having been summarily dealt with by the overwhelming majority of the committee, they have proceeded with a "Dutch auction", and are prepared to accept an increase of 33 per cent. - the lowest bidder not necessarily being the taker. Let us analyse the remarks of the honorable member who has just spoken. He has appealed to the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  to overrule the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost).**  He believes that, by specious pleading, he may divide Ministers on this measure. I inform him that the Government party decided that the bill should be placed before the House in its present form. All Ministers had the opportunity to discuss the matters that have been raised by the honorable gentleman. He has said that he does not find fault with the special committee, but that he has some fault to find with its judgment. The special committee asked every member of this Parliament, if he had any information to disclose, to furnish it in writing or by a personal appearance before it. The honorable gentleman neither wrote to nor appeared before the committee, but with all his remarkable knowledge, waited until it had come to a decision. 

##### Mr Rankin:

--  Did the honorable member for Dalley appear before the special committee for the purpose of giving evidence ? 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- I did not. I am satisfied with .the results of its labours. 

##### Mr Rankin:

--  The honorable member did not know what those results might be. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- I am not criticizing the decisions of the special committee. Whatever criticism I had to offer was stated at a party meeting, and I did not gain any publicity from my representations. What did the honorable member for Warringah do to assist the special committee to form its judgment, with which he now finds some fault? He has criticized the Minister because that honorable gentleman will not accept an increase greater than that recommended by the special committee last September. He has pointed out, with a certain degree of logic, that there has since been an increase of the cost of living. He considers that that is a fatal bar to the acceptance of an increase of 20 per cent. I remind honorable members that until this Government assumed office the honorable gentleman was agreeable to returned soldiers having pensions based on figures that were twenty years old. For the whole of the time during which the Government of which he was a supporter or ,a member had been in office, he had taken no part in an amendment of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. I have no recollection of his having reminded his own Government that it based existing rates of pay to soldiers on an act twenty years old. Tet he considers that a decision made five months ago must on that account be debarred. What are the facts? There is not to be a flat rate increase of 20 per cent. The special committee exhaustively examined every section of those, who are to receive pensions from the Repatriation Department. It is true that there is to be an all-round increase of 20 per cent. ; but in the most deserving cases - the children of soldiers, who are unable to help themselves - the special committee has recommended, and the Government has accepted, an increase as high as 66jj- per cent. I trust that the Government will accept the proposal in regard to tubercular soldiers who are paid the service pension, whereas they are probably entitled to the rate provided for tubercular soldiers - an increase of over 200 per cent. To say that this is not a generous scheme is simply to beg the question. The honorable member for Warringah has said that the special committee had no scientific basis for its recommendation of 20 per cent. If I am not mistaken, one of the bases upon which he has made his calculations is that the matter has some relation to the pay of the soldiers. I again remind him that it was the present Government which raised the pay of soldiers to the existing rates. Had the special committee accepted as a basis for computation the pay of soldiers while the honorable gentleman was Minister for the Army, it would have recommended considerably less than the proposed 20 per cent. It is rather disgusting that honorable members who occupied prominent positions in previous administrations, such as the honorable member for Warringah, and whose influence was undoubtedly great, did not contribute to an improvement of the circumstances of returned soldiers and. their dependants. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  That is not correct. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- What is more, it was left to a different Government to do something for the returned soldiers who are living, as well as for the relatives of those who have died. 

##### Mr Rankin:

--  The munitions workers were given an increase of £1, and the soldiers ls. 

##### Mr Curtin:

--  The Government has. not interfered with the rates of pay of munitions workers. Their wages are now fixed on the same basis as they were when this party was in opposition. 

##### Mr Rankin:

--  The soldier has no Arbitration Court to which he may appeal. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-If the honorable member for Warringah were sincere in his desire to assist the returned soldiers, surely he could have done something while he was an influential member of previous governments. Also, he could have placed his views before the parliamentary committee which examined this matter, either orally, or in writing, to assist that body in arriving at its decision. But he did not do that. Instead, he comes here and says that nothing less than a 50 per cent, increase will meet the situation, and now that that proposal has been defeated, apparently he is prepared to compromise on a 33-J per cent, increase. No doubt, if someone moved that the increase be 25 per cent, he would support the proposal with the same enthusiasm as he brought to the moving of the previous amendment. 

##### Sir FREDERICK STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">Parramatta</small>

.- The Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  has intimated that the Government will adhere to the decision made in regard to the previous proposed amendment. In the absence of evidence to the contrary - the Minister did not elaborate his intimation - we can only assume that the same factors which influenced the Government in arriving at that decision are prompting its opposition to the proposal now before us. Not the least important of the reasons given this afternoon for the Government's defence of this clause is the alleged inability of the Treasury to pay a further increase. Surely that is not the usual principle followed in determining payment for services rendered to the Government, or compensation for disabilities. Only last week Judge O'Mara gave a decision in the Arbitration Court affecting rates of pay of men who are recruited for work on defence projects, in almost the same way as are members of our fighting forces. The judge made an award which, so far as it applies to single and married men without children, is very much in advance of the rates of pay received by single soldiers, or married soldiers without dependants. Did Judge O'Mara consult the Treasurer, or officials of his department, before making that award? Did the judge ask whether the Treasury could afford to pay the increased rates? I am sure that he did not, and considerations of economics should not enter into the discussion which is taking place on this measure. Basing my calculations on information given by the Minister for Repatriation and by members of the parliamentary committee, the cost of a 33 per cent. increase would he approximately £1,000,000. Press reports indicate that before the present sittings of Parliament conclude, the Government will bring down a measure providing for the payment of a bonus upon the production of superphosphate, in order to ensure that supplies shall be available for agricultural purposes. I have been in this House long enough, and I have participated in discussions upon superphosphate often enough, to know that the money involved in the payment of such a bonus will be very much more than £1,000,000. It seems to me, therefore, that if the Treasury can afford more than £1,000,000 to enrich our agricultural lands, it can also afford the same amount not to enrich, but to succour disabled soldiers and their dependants. 

##### Mr RANKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bendigo</small>

.-I shall support the proposal that war pensions be increased by  33  per cent. instead of 20 per cent, although my own view is that an increase of 30 per cent. would be sufficient, on the basis of the increased cost of living. I believe, also, that the parliamentary committee did not take into consideration the increase of soldiers' pay since the war of 1914-18. Apparently the people of Australia, and of many other countries, adhere to the old conception of a soldier. Years ago soldiers on the battle-field received mere subsistence until such time as they could capture a city and recompense themselves by unrestricted looting. The honorable member for Dally  **(Mr. Rosevear)**  springs from a race that has lived by such methods. In fact, it overran the entire world in that way. Soldiers to-day are entitled to at least the same conditions and rights as the men who remain in their own country. They have a right to expect not mere subsistence but a remuneration sufficient to guarantee a reasonable standard of comfort in the autumn of their lives. It has been pointed out that the proposal to increase war pensions by more than 20 per cent. is supported largely by honorable members from New South Wales. I have never been a champion of the people of that State, but, although I am not prepared to go the whole distance with them and support a 50 per cent. increase, I concede that there is a good deal of merit in the claim that the Government's proposals do not go far enough. I point out that the Victorian branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has made the following recommendation in regard to column 4 of the first schedule: - 

  >It is suggested that the rates of pension as shown in this column should be increased proportionately with the increase in the rate of pay of a private soldier at the present time as compared with his pay during the last war. 

That is the vital question. The pay of soldiers has been increased by 41.6 per cent., but the increase of the cost of living also has been very great. I have no doubt that the Minister for Repatriation has a great deal of sympathy for returned soldiers, but he knows very well that the Government intends to bring down a number of measures that will cost much more than would an increase of war pensions by 33-J per cent. We have already passed a vague social welfare measure which will cost this country £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 a year for the next four or five years; yet the Minister says that it is impossible to agree to a proposal to give an additional £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 to returned soldiers and their dependants. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  "We have not claimed that it is impossible. 


 **Mr. - BARNARD,** -  Nothing of the kind was said. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- I am afraid that the knowledge that the honorable member for Bass  **(Mr. Barnard)**  has of this bill and of military matters generally is as scant as his hair. I say to the  Minister  and to the honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard),**  that, in my view, the parliamentary committee has done a good job, although I believe that members of it were obsessed with a single idea : They thought that they could get. only a  certain  amount of money for returned soldiers, and that amount formed the basis of their recommendations. They did not realize that the Government would have the audacity to inaugurate a social service scheme which would cost between £30.000,000 and £40;000,000 a year during war-time; but that has happened. In order to gain the support of people in the lower income group on whom income tax is to be imposed for the first time, the Government announced that a certain proportion of the revenue so derived would be placed in a trust fund and kept for expenditure for social services after the war. . But the truth is that the money is to be used for war purposes. 

The  **CHAIRMAN (Mr. Prowse).Order!**  The honorable member must keep to the subject-matter of the bill. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- With respect to you,  **Mr. Chairman,**  I submit that I am dealing with the subject-matter of the bill. The question we are now discussing is can we afford to increase by 20 per cent. or 30 per cent, the pensions of the men who are fighting for our very right to exist. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The committee is now discussing the postponement of clause 3 of this bill, and the honorable member is not entitled to refer to a measure which already has passed through both Houses. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- The honorable member for Dalley was allowed to speak of a Dutch auction; if there is anything in the bill about that I have not seen it. The honorable member reminded me of the member of his race who said, " What does it matter so long as we make a profit " ? When it comes to a little bit of profit for the man who returns to this country with a war injury or suffering from the after effects of malaria, a little bit of profit is made a big issue. When I hear honorable members opposite speaking of the rights of men who work in munition factories - perhaps I should say " loaf " in munitions factories - I wonder if there is any justice in their minds. When one compares the sacrifices made by men during their years of service in the fighting forces with what is being done by those who work - as they say - in the coalmines, and for whose benefit it is proposed to expend between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000 a year on social services, one is tempted to ask what is wrong with Australia. Does the Government believe that, if it persists in its present purpose, the young men of Australia will on a future occasion rush to the defence of the country ? 

##### Sir GEORGE BELL:<br><small class="text-muted">DARWIN, TASMANIA &middot; NAT; UAP from 1931</small>

--  They are not serving for the sake of the few shillings they get. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- No, but they are serving in order to ensure decent living conditions for their wives and children. Why do we fight another nation? For one reason only - because we believe that the conditions of life which that nation would impose upon us if it could are such that Ave would die rather than accept them. If the Government insists that it cannot give to the returned soldiers and their dependants a few extra shillings a week while it can afford £30,000,000 in time of war for an already top-heavy system of social services, the people of Australia will quickly put it in its right place. The honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron)'**  said that the Government should be judged on what it has done. "When I consider what the Government has done for the defence of Australia, for the Army, and for the soldiers and their dependants, all I can say is that its proper reward would be not more than a farthing in a hundred years. 

##### Mr SPOONER:<br><small class="text-muted">Robertson</small>

.- I agree that we are not bound, to accept the recommendation of even an all-party parliamentary committee, but before agreeing to accept any proposal at variance with its recommendation I shall want to be convinced that it is based on sound premises. I do not take my stand in opposition to the amendment because I am slavishly adhering to the recommendation of the parliamentary committee. Neither do I charge with insincerity any honorable member who differs from me on this matter. However, I am convinced that my desire to further the interests of the returned soldiers is as strong as that of any other honorable member. I am now more convinced than ever that the opinion which I expressed during the second-reading debate is correct, namely, that Parliament cannot be expected to weigh figures and statistics, and fix a proper percentage for pensions increases. Those figures must be checked and examined, and this is not the place in which to do it. As one of the few members from New South Wales who do not support the amendment, I say that I shall be just as ready as any one else to vote for higher pensions when a recommendation to that effect is made by a properly constituted committee. As I said yesterday, if the parliamentary committee believed in September last that .a 20 per cent, increase would be a fair one, it might, if it were making its report to-day iri the light of changed circumstances, recommend a greater increase, say 25 per cent. However, I am not suggesting that we should decide upon that figure. Before another variation is made, the whole matter should be gone into carefully. I am convinced that the standing committee on repatriation, when it is appointed, will give this question the consideration due to it.  If it recommends, within the next few months, that pensions should be further increased, I shall not hesitate to support its recommendation. I am eager and anxious to discover ways in which to help the returned soldiers, provided action be taken in the proper way. I am convinced that the Government is doing the right thing in reconstituting the parliamentary committee. It will pursue its inquiries further, and Parliament will have an opportunity later to review the decision we are about to make. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">Barker &middot; ALP</small>

--  To a returned soldier it is distasteful that there should be a public debate on this subject of percentage increases. If honorable members think that they are getting on the right side of returned soldiers by precipitating a prolonged discussion on this issue, let me assure them, as one who has had something to do with the league, that they are making one of the worst blunders of their lives. Returned soldiers believe . that -a matter of this kind should be settled without having a dogfight in Parliament. I ask honorable members what we can give to a soldier in return for the loss of his sight. Put that loss in terms of money! Assess in money the loss of a man whose both arms are amputated at the elbows so that he is dependent upon some one else for the very meanest offices in life ! How are we to assess his disability? How are we to decide whether his pension should be increased by 20 per cent, or 33 per cent. ? 

##### Mr Conelan:

--  The mental cases are the worst. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- That is so. No monetary payment could compensate a man for the loss of his reason. A prolonged and acrimonious debate of this kind is unseemly in a national Parliament. That is why I, as one who has seen some service, have had little to say. I have great sympathy with some of the views expressed by the honorable member for Bendigo  **(Mr. Rankin).**  No one has stood up more manfully than he for the rights of returned soldiers. I maintain that this matter should be gone into carefully without turning it into a public dispute, and dragging in the rights and wrongs of returned soldiers and.. their dependants. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  That is why the Government appointed a parliamentary committee to consider it. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- As I said this afternoon, that was one of the best things which the Government has done. It would have been better, however, if the Government had pushed this bill through earlier instead of going on with its social service legislation. Some of them are of a most fragmentary and nebulous character, and have been referred to as subjects upon which there should be a dissolution of the Parliament and an appeal to the people. Repatriation problems are of such importance that attention might well have been given to this bill before entering upon the long debate that has' taken place on those other matters. The parliamentary special committee has done good work, and has arrived at a fair decision. Repatriation matters are a constant and continuing responsibility, which will not end with the passage of this bill. "We should not say that, after granting a certain percentage increase of war pensions, the position should be left at that. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia will be an efficient watch-dog over this or any other government. I should prefer the determination of our obligations to returned soldiers and their dependants to be left to the good sense and judgment of the league, rather than to any permanent parliamentary committee. The reconstitution of the committee is one of the unwise things that the Government has agreed to do, and its action will be regretted by it, or  it3  successors in due course; but the responsibility devolves upon this Parliament to see, not only that every soldier who comes back from the war with ' injuries is looked after, but also that every widow, and every child who is left fatherless, is also cared for. That, again, is not a subject that should be discussed in this Parliament for days at a time. A committee representative of all political parties, or, as the honorable member for Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald)**  has said-, consisting of men from the rank of colonel to that of a private soldier, has agreed upon certain recommendations- With great respect for the independence of judgment of the individual - and few honorable members exercise independence of judgment more than I do- surely this Parliament can agree to what the Government has proposed in this instance, without a lot of fuss and bother, and without giving the impression to the people , outside that we are engaged in a sort of Dutch auction. I say that with a good deal of feeling. 

##### Mr Rankin:

--  Does not the honorable gentleman agree that the outlook has greatly changed since the Government has' brought down a scheme for the provision of  £30,000,000  or  £40,000,000  a year for increased social services? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- I realize that that change has come about; but, if the financial status of the returned soldier changes much for the worse within the next few months, not this, but another Parliament will put that matter right. 

This bill is a very fair one, and is a great improvement on any measure of the kind placed on the statute-book for a considerable period. Until sixteen months ago, the Opposition was in charge of the Treasury, and, as far as my memory serves me, it did' not appoint a committee to investigate the repatriation problems which were not beyond the minds of many of us on this side of the chamber. We realized that they would naturally arise as soon as men returned from the theatres of war. Every war causes its own problems, and, similarly, the aftermath of war leaves special problems to be solved. What happened between  1919  and  1922  will not be a guide to us in deciding what we may have to do to meet the conditions that will arise after the present war. Realizing the strong claims of the returned soldiers and of those whose menfolk will not return, I am convinced that this bill should be passed without lengthy discussion of the kind to which we have listened in this chamber in the last few days. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">Parkes</small>

-- When I submitted the amendment, I did not make a speech upon it, because I thought that this committee would accept it. unanimously. Every honorable member who has spoken on the bill, irrespective of his political affiliations, has eulogized the work of the parliamentary ex-servicemen's committee, and so have I. The honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron)**  expressed' the view that this matter should not form the subject of a political discussion; but, because certain honorable members of the Opposition have suggested amendments, we now have before us a sheaf of proposed amendments, circulated by other honorable members, providing for increases of the war pensions. The honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  went out of his way to insult those of us who have espoused the cause of soldiers' widows. My amendment was that the pension should be increased by 13 per cent., yet the honorable member  for  Moreton has circulated an amendment to provide for an increase of 14 per cent. ! Does he imagine that no other honorable member has the right to speak on behalf of the returned soldiers? He desires to have the honour of proposing the successful amendment. Yesterday I spoke on behalf of soldiers' widows, and I invited the honorable member for Barker and other honorable members to meet those women and say to them, " This poor, God-forsaken country cannot afford to pay to you what you received when your husbands were alive ". I invite honorable members to talk to those widows, and to consider the claims of their children. Honorable members can be brave and valiant in this chamber. This afternoon I referred to the men who serve in the malaria-infested swamps of New Guinea. We should ask them what they think about this discussion. If I were invited to  Organize  the soldiers of this country to enable them to fight for their rights, I would do it. I will not be guided in this matter by political parties or opinions. I do not care whether I remain a member of this Parliament or not; but, so long  as  I am here, I shall not allow the position to be camouflaged by members who wish to submit amendments and object to amendments being moved by anybody else. I hope that the people of Australia will take cognizance of the fact that this Parliament has no intention to give to the widows and children of soldiers the rates of pay which they enjoyed when their bread-winners were alive. I invite the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear),**  whose electorate adjoins my own, to hold a meeting on the border of the two electorates, so that he may tell the electors that this Parliament has no intention to provide that the widows and children of soldiers shall be maintained at the same level as whentheir husbands and fathers were alive. I was fair in my remarks on the bill yesterday, and I commended the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  for having adopted the report of the parliamentary ex-servicemen's committee; but we who are advocating an increase of pension rates are accused of having been influenced by representations that come only from New South Wales. I remind the committee that New South Wales is the Mother State of the Commonwealth. 

##### Mr FROST:

--  What has that to do with the matter? 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- Tasmania, from which the Minister comes, is a mendicant State that is dependent on New South Wales to a large degree for grants to keep it solvent. 

##### Mr FROST:

--  That is a cheap gibe, and about in keeping with the rest of the honorable member's speech. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The honorable member must confine his remarks to the bill. The financial position of Tasmania has nothing to do with the question before the Chair. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  I ask for a withdrawal of the honorable member's offensive statement. A sham fighter should not make such a remark about an honorable State. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The remark was not unparliamentary. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- The amendment that I have had the honour to move provides for the postponement of the consideration of this clause, and the matters that I have mentioned can, I submit, be advanced in support of the amendment. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- That will be determined by the Chair. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- That may lead to argument; but it will not prevent me from expressing my views on the matter. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The honorable member must not defy the Chair. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I have too much respect for you,  **Mr. Chairman,**  to do that. After attending party meetings, and agreeing to my party doing certain things, I do not, on return to this chamber, ignore the decision of my party and vote in an opposite direction. If the honorable member for Moreton has not made up his mind in accordance with the views of his party, that is a good reason for the postponement of the clause, so that he may have further time to consider it. I have been accused, of insincerity, and I resent that. I have not accused any honorable members opposite of being insincere. Two of the four members of the all-party special committee represent this chamber, and both of them have admitted that the proposals of the Government* are insufficient. The honorable member for Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald)**  has been eulogized for the speech which he delivered last night. What, did he say? He admitted, in effect, that since September the Victorian branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia had advanced the fact that the pay of soldiers had been increased by 47 per cent. The honorable member for Moreton, claiming to be the only one with the right to speak on behalf of the soldiers, has brought along an amendment aimed at increasing the pensions for widows by 14 per cent. I asked the committee to agree to increase the pension for widows by 13 per cent. The honorable member for Moreton now admits that he and the other members of the special committee made a mistake. The amount of increase I propose is lower than that proposed by the honorable member. 

##### Mr Marwick:

-- But the honorable member's proposal covers a wider field. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- How much wider? The special committee admitted that some pensions should be increased by as . much as 66$ per cent. The two cases I mentioned last night are deserving of the utmost consideration. Even if we do not increase the pensions of soldiers, we have a duty to the widows  and  the .orphans, particularly those orphans both of whose parents are dead, and as long as the Lord spa res me breath 

I will do all in my power to ensure that that duty shall be done. I shall support the amendment which the honorable member for Moreton proposes to move. The honorable- member this afternoon eulogized the right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes),**  whose enthusiastic activity on behalf of ex-servicemen no one can doubt or surpass. Yet, although the right honorable gentleman, in his second-reading speech, recommended the acceptance of the bill as being the result of the report of the special committee, he has also brought along a sheaf of amendments. It would appear that only the Minister for Repatriation, members of the special committee, and the right honorable member for North Sydney are entitled to move amendments, and that returned soldier members from constituencies in New South Wales are disqualified. The Minister for Home Security  **(Mr. Lazzarini)**  may laugh, but if -a government formed' from our ranks brought, down a bill increasing the rate of repatriation pensions by only 20 per cent, he would be amongst those clamouring for a greater increase. I regret the intrusion of personalities into this discussion. 

The  **CHAIRMAN (Mr. Prowse).Order**  ! The honorable member's time has expired. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:<br><small class="text-muted">Richmond</small>

.- Adoption of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr)**  for the postponement of the clause for the purpose stated by him would compel the withdrawal of the bill in order that it might be redrafted. About six months has elapsed since the special committee considered this matter, and it has taken from September to now to get the bill before Parliament. If the amendment were carried it would be another six months before we should have another opportunity to consider the matter, because, after next week, Parliament will go into a long recess. For the benefit of thosewho will come within the ambit of this measure, I protest against any postponement, any withdrawal or any redraftingof it, and demand its immediate passage,, in order that the Senate may deal with it next week and enable the benefits proposed in it to be conferred upon returned soldiers and their dependants as early as possible.

Question so resolved in the negative. 

Clause agreed to. 

Clause 4 - 

  >Section four of the Principal Act is amended by omitting the words " Division 6 - Extension of Application of Provisions of Divisions 1 to 4." and inserting in their stead the words - " Division6 - Extension of Application of Provisions of Divisions 1 to 5 to certain male Members of Forces.

  >Division 7 - Extension of Application of Provisions of Divisions 1 to 5 to Members of Women's Services.".

-- I move - 

  >That all the words after " Principal Act " be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words: - " is amended - 
  >
  >by omitting the words 'Division6 - 

Extension of Application of Provisions of Divisions 1 to 4.' and inserting in their stead the words - 

 Division 6 - Extension of Application of Provisions of Divisions 1 to 5 to certain Male Members of the Forces. 

Division 7 - Extension of Application of Provisions of Divisions 1 to 5 to Members of Women's Services.'; and 

{: type="a" start="b"}
0. by inserting, after the words 'Part IV. - Assistance and Benefits.', the words ' Part IVa. - Parliamentary Standing Committee on Repatriation.' " 

This amendment is necessary in order to provide in the preliminary parts of the bill machinery to enable the inclusion at a late stage of new clauses empowering the appointment of a standing committee on repatriation. The committee which I propose shall be established is one similar to the joint committee of both Houses which inquired into and reported on the Repatriation Act prior to the preparation of this bill. The worth of the findings of that committee has been revealed during the debate that has taken place; from all sides the committee has been commended for the work that it has done and for its recommendations. I submit that a parliamentary standing committee consisting of members of both Houses, to which the Minister could submit matters relating to repatriation, would be of great value in investigating anomalies which must arise from time to time in legislation so comprehensive as the Repatriation Act. As the Minister has intimated that he is prepared to accept an amendment to provide for the establishment of a standing committee, I do not propose to discuss the matter at length at this stage. 

##### Mr SPOONER:<br><small class="text-muted">Robertson</small>

.- I shall support the amendment as a preliminaryto the introduction of a new part which will provide for the appointment of a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Repatriation. The existence of such a committee will, I believe, be a! guarantee that there will be a continuous review of the pensions which are now to be increased. At this stage, I do not propose to speak of the provisions for a standing committee, because they will be discussed later, but with all respect to thehonorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles),** 

I submit that his amendment should have been moved by the Minister. A matter of high policy is involved. The suggestion that a standing committee should be appointed was first made by the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis),**  and at a subsequent stage I also mentioned it. I believe that the inclusion of a new Part IVa. to provide for a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Repatriation, is an important part of the bill, and therefore the Minister should take the responsibility, as well as the credit, for the amendment. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  What does it matter who moves it ? 

##### Mr SPOONER:

-- It matters a great deal. It is a matter of policy. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  Some of the amendments which the right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes)**  proposes to move are also most important. 

##### Mr SPOONER:

-- The amendment of the honorable member for Henty has arisen out of the discussion over pensions. It is a way out of the trouble. I am convinced that the Government is doing the right thing in providing machinery for the establishment permanently of a committee which has already done an excellent job, but, in my opinion, the amendment should have been moved by the Minister. 

##### Mr Duncan-Hughes:

--  I rise to a point of order. I desire to know whether, under the heading " Parliamentary Standing Committee on Repatriation ", honorable members are entitled to discuss what is intended to be done by clauses which are not at present before the committee, and of which they have no knowledge except a notice circulated in printed form. If the Chair allows a general debate on this headline, we may have the whole debate repeated when we come to deal with proposed new Part IVa. Surely the discussion should be limited to the main clause? Otherwise the whole subject would be open to discussion. How can we discuss the terms of a clause which is not before us? I ask for a ruling that the real discussion of the proposal to appoint a standing committee should take place in connexion with proposed new clause 39a, and not in respect of a single headline. 

The  **CHAIRMAN (Mr. Prowse).The**  amendment of the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles)**  introduces the principle, and, in the opinion of the Chair, this is the best place to discuss it. 

##### Mr Duncan-Hughes:

--  I take it that the whole question is open for discussion now, including matters which will not come before the committee until we reach proposed new clause 39a.? 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- It is in order to discuss the principle at this stage. If honorable members wish to do that the Chair has no objection. 

##### Sir George Bell:

--  There will be a lot of discussion of other matters before we reach the proposed new clause, and therefore I submit that the discussion of the main amendment ought not to take place now. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  Is there any opposition to the establishment, of a standing committee? 

##### Mr Jolly:

--  Yes. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The principle is introduced here, and may be discussed now if the committee so desires. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  If we are to deal with the whole subject, we must go into details. I suggest that the discussion be postponed until we reach the proposed new clause. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- I should like to have an expression of the committee's views. 

##### Mr Harrison:

--  We must discuss the principle fully before we can agree to this amendment, otherwise we shall commit ourselves to something, and later be able to deal only with the details. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Spender)**  agreed to - 

  >That further consideration of the clause and amendment be postponed until after the consideration of proposed new clauses. 

Clause postponed accordingly. 

Clauses 5 to 13 agreed to. 

Clause 14 - 

  >Section twenty-three of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from sub-section (3.) the word "Act" (second occurring) and inserting in its stead the word " Division ". 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">North Sydney</small>

-- Amendments which I suggest should be made to a number of clauses have been circulated. As the first amendment is consequential upon a series of amendments in clauses18, 21, 23 and 33  -  all of which deal with the same matter,  although, perhaps, from different angles - it will assist the committee if I deal with them in a general way. Clause 18 proposes to amend section 39b of the principal act, and has relation to what may be termed the onus of proof. Proposed new section 39b is a most important clause; it gives statutory form to the present practice of the commission, and makes clear that the provision in section 39b of the principal act which relates only to the commission shall extend to the board, an appeal tribunal, and an assessment appeal tribunal. This provides that " the commission, board, appeal tribunal and assessment appeal tribunal, in hearing, determining or deciding a claim, application or appeal, shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, shall not be bound by technicalities or legal forms or rules of evidence and shall give to the claimant, applicant or appellant, the benefit of any doubt . . . " By a further proposed amendment of clause18 the position of the claimant, applicant or appellant is to be improved by deleting the word " conelusive", so that the claimant, applicant or appellant shall have to furnish proof, but not " conclusive proof ", to support his claim, application or appeal. Clause 18 also inserts the following new section :  - 39c. A medical practitioner shall, in reporting on any claim in relation to a member of "the forces, set out in his report his opinion - 

{: type="a" start="a"}
0. in the case of a claim in respect of the death of the member - as to the cause of the death; and 
1. in the case of a claim in respect of the incapacity of the member - as to the nature, cause and extent of the incapacity. and shall also set out whether, in his opinion, the death or incapacity of the member - 
2. has been contributed to in any material degree by the conditions of his war service. 

I desire to amend sub-paragraph v to read - 

{: type="a" start="v"}
0. has been contributed to in any material degree, or has been aggravated, by the conditions of his war service. and to have that phraseology adopted in the bill wherever the qualification of a claimant for a pension is referred to. The word " aggravated " is omitted from the bill as it now stands. I thought that such omission weakened the position of a claimant, applicant or appellant; and after consulting with the Minister and the Attorney-General, it has been agreed that the word "aggravated" shall be inserted. In order that the meaning of aggravation shall not be qualified by the words " in any material degree ", the phraseology will read in every case as follows, " contributed to in any material degree, or has been aggravated by, the conditions of his war service ". Wherever the bill deals with the qualification of a claimant, applicant or appellant, and the issue is whether the disability from which the claimant, applicant or appellant suffers is due to war service, or has been contributed to in any material degree by his war service, the following words are to be added, " or has been aggravated by the conditions of his war service ". The Minister is thoroughly seised of the import of the amendments. I wish only to say, although I do not press the matter, that I should have taken the gravest exception to the clauses providing for reference to a medical practitioner of matters which go to the very root of the claimant's position, were it not for the fact that the honorable member for Moreton (Mr.Francis) has been assured that men suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis will not be placed in the position where such a reference is necessary. I am satisfied that no man, no mattter how expert he may be, can say whether pulmonary tuberculosis from which the returned soldier is now suffering twenty years after the war is, or is not, due to, or has been aggravated by, war service. But as sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis are now assured recognition once it is proved that they were members of the military forces, and are otherwise eligible for a pension, the question cannot arise. This will be received by the tubercular men with immense relief. They will get the pension which the bill, as amended, directs shall be paid, and, once given, under section 31a of the principal act cannot be altered or taken away. This benefit is now being extended to service pensioners. Thus, we are free from many of the difficulties which previously confronted us in respect of this particular matter. I urge that the amendments be accepted. 

They have been carefully considered. The phraseology is somewhat difficult; but I am satisfied that the effect of the amendments will be to improve very greatly the position of a claimant, applicant or appellant. It is in the interests of the returned men that these amendments be made. I move - 

  >That all the words after " Principal Act " be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words: - " is amended - 
  >
  >by omitting paragraph (a) of subsection (2.) and inserting in its stead the following paragraph: - 
  >
  >the incapacity from which the member is suffering or from which he has died has been contributed to in any material degree, or has been aggravated, by the conditions of his war service; and'; and 
  >
  >by omitting from sub-section (3.) the word 'Act' ( second occurring ) and inserting in its stead the word  Division ' ". 

##### Dr EVATT:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; Barton &middot; ALP</small>

-- The right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes)**  has tabled a series of amendments, all of which flow from the alteration which he desires to have made in clause 18, which deals with the "benefit of the doubt". I should be glad, therefore, of liberty from the Chair to discuss clause 18 in association with this clause. Clause 14, which is before the committee, makes alterations in the machinery providing for the general tests of entitlement to be applied to individual cases. Section 39b of the act directs that, subject to the act - 

  >The commission shall, in the determination of appeals, act according to the substantial justice and to the merits of each case, and shall give to the appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt. 

Section 45w provides that in proceedings before the Assessment Appeal Tribunal the onus of proof shall lie with the commission. Honorable members who are familiar with the act will realize that a provision of that character is of great advantage to members of the forces, particularly when it is compared with the provision which appears in workers' compensation legislation which places the onus of proof upon claimants, and thereby handicaps them in that they are required to provide strict proof of their claims. As the Repatriation Act now stands the provisions dealing with the " benefit of the doubt " and " onus of proof " are of limited application, for the first one applies only to appeals before the commission, and the other only to appeals before the appellate tribunal. The provision in the bill ensures a much more comprehensive application of these rules, for proposed new sections 39b and 39c provide that the " benefit of the doubt " rule shall apply to the whole range of authorities involved in the legislation. Proposed new sub-section 1 of proposed new section 39b provides-  (1.) The Commission, a Board, an Appeal Tribunal and an Assessment Appeal Tribunal, in hearing, determining or deciding a claim, application or appeal, shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, shall not be bound by technicalities or legal forms or rules of evidence and shall give to the claimant, applicant or appellant the benefit of any doubt - 

{: type="a" start="a"}
0. as to the existence of any fact, matter, cause or circumstance which would be favorable to the claimant, applicant or appellant; or 
1. as to any question whatsoever which arises for decision under his claim, application or appeal. 

In other words, if any question which is material to the case before any of these tribunals cannot be placed beyond doubt, the question must be determined in favour of the member of the forces. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  It is usually claimed by the authorities that there are no doubts. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- If there be, in fact, no doubts, then another position arises. 

##### Mr Menzies:

--  What is the significance of the words " conclusive proof " in proposed new sub-section 2 of this new section ? 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- I shall come to that point presently. Section 45 w of the act provides that - 

  >If the appellant or a representative of the appellant shall make out a prima facie case in support of his claim that the incapacity from which he is suffering or from which he has died was caused or aggravated by war service, the onus of proof that such incapacity was not in fact so caused or aggravated shall lie with the commission. 

##### Mr Hughes:

--  In other words, the appellant has only to aver it. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- That is so. I believe that the right honorable member was himself responsible for the inclusion of  that provision in the act. He now says that he wishes to make it perfectly clear that aggravation, as well as " contribution to a material degree " to incapacity or death, is to come under the same rule so that " onus of proof " as to aggravation shall also lie with the commission. Of course the "benefit of the doubt" would still be given to the appellant. In short, the right honorable member's amendments provide that the pension shall be granted whether the appellant's condition was due to war service or was only aggravated by war service. 

##### Mr Francis:

-- The pension granted shall be according to the degree of dis.ability 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- That is so. The right honorable member for Kooyong  **(Mr. Menzies)**  has asked a question concerning the use of the words " conclusive proof ". The sentence in which those words appear was taken directly from the Canadian repatriation act. But it may be said, " If it is not necessary to furnish conclusive proof, it is clear that some proof short of conclusive proof must be submitted ". 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- I take it that " some proof" means "some evidence"? 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- Undoubtedly. The whole purpose of this provision is to reverse completely the method of proof and to put the burden of proof upon the authorities to negative any connexion between war service and the disability. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- That provision exists now. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- But not in a way which is so clear and satisfactory as is stated in the proposed new section. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- It means that the authority and not the claimant will produce the evidence. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- That is so. As to the actual incapacity and the fact that the claimant had some wa.r service there is never any question. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- I only desired to be sure that I understood the point. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-That is the reason for the omission of the word " conclusive ". I do not think that the word is essential, but the right honorable gentleman considers that it is desirable, and I have no objection to it. Proposed new section 39b (2) deals with the onus of proof, which is placed on the authority that contests the claim. The onus of proof extends, not merely to the entitlement, but also to the degree of pension. Proposed new section 39c is an attempt to give some reality to the real benefit of the doubt. When the medical practitioner - and that includes the medical practitioner at every relevant stage, even before the soldier is discharged from the forces - entertains a doubt about the cause of a disability or death, he is required to state that doubt. Where the doubt is as to the cause or to the degree of incapacity, he is under an obligation to state it. Honorable members will see how that provision may work. A medical practitioner can say : " This injury may have .relation to war service. I cannot say that it has not. But it could be caused by war service ". In expressions like that, he will indicate his doubt about the whole matter. He will provide the material upon which the statutory tribunals will give to the man the benefit of the doubt. 

##### Mr Hughes:

-- But that does not relieve the Repatriation Commission or the tribunal of their responsibilities. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- As the right honorable gentleman points out, that, in itself, whether or not it is satisfactory, does not rel] eve the commission or the tribunals of their duty to give to the man the benefit of the doubt. 

##### Mr Calwell:

-- Will this provision retrospectively cover the cases of men who have died? 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- This provision deals with cases that henceforth will come before the tribunals. 

##### Mr Calwell:

-- Before the bill reaches the third-reading stage, will the AttorneyGeneral examine the legislation so as to ensure that persons who die prior to this measure becoming operative will be eligible to receive the same benefits as persons who survive? 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- The Minister will consider the matter. The right honorable member for North Sydney desires to make the provision even more satisfactory from the point of view of the soldiers, and I have taken part in drafting the amendments that he has forecast. I emphasize that if any fact arises or has to be determined, the onus of negativing anything of benefit to the soldier rests with the commission or tribunal. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- That has always been so. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- It is useless for the honorable member to repeat that claim. Any doubt that arises must be resolved, in every case, in favour of the men. 

##### Mr Beck:

-- That clarifies the whole matter. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- I think it does. The soldiers of the last war regard the rule as to the benefit of the doubt as being of fundamental importance. The reversal of ordinary procedure is rather extraordinary and such a provision does not exist, in this comprehensive form, in any other part of the British Empire. 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- This will be an example for the rest of the Empire to follow. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- In my opinion, it is beneficial and desirable. The amendments proposed by the right honorable member for North Sydney are a further improvement. 

##### Mr Calwell:

-- Has the AttorneyGeneral accepted both amendments? 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- Yes.

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">North SydneyDeputy Leader of the Opposition</small>

.- I move- 

  >That, in proposed new section 39b (1.) (6), after the word " whatsoever " the following words be inserted: - " (including the question whether the incapacity from which the member of the Forces is suffering or from which he has died was contributed to in any material degree, or was aggravated, by the conditions of his war service) ". 

This matter has been explained by the Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt),**  and I commend the amendment to the committee. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- An amendment standing in my name relates to this clause. The right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes)**  and I are in agreement in our desire to achieve the best results for the soldiers, but our views differ as to how that can be accomplished. I should like to clarify the position under the act. Section 39b reads - 

  >Subject to this Act, the Commission shall, in the determination of appeals, act according to substantial justice and to the merits of each case, and shall give to an appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt. 

Sub-sections 2, 3 and 4 of section 45 w, which are repealed by the bill, read - (2.) Subject to this Act, an Appeal Tribunal and an Assessment Appeal Tribunal shall not, in the hearing of appeals, be bound by any rules of evidence but shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case and shall give to an appellant the benefit of the doubt: 

  >Provided that if the appellant or a representative of the appellant shall make out a prima facie case in support of his claim that the incapacity from which he is suffering or from which he has died was caused or aggravated by war service, the onus of proof that such incapacity was not in fact so caused or aggravated shall lie with the Commission. 
  >
  >Provided further that in the case of the death caused by an accident, of a member of the forces who is wholly or partially incapacitated as the result of war service, the burden of proving that such incapacity did not contribute to a material degree to the death of the member shall lie upon the Commission. (3.) The hearing of any appeal under this Part shall not be open to the public. (4.) For the purposes of sub-section (2.) of this section an appellant shall be deemed to have made out a prima facie case when he avers that the incapacity or death of the member of the Forces resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces or from his employment in connexion with naval or military preparations or operations or is directly attributable to his employment as a member of the Forces. 

This clause purports, first, to make a common rule in respect of all tribunals, and, secondly, to make it clearer that the burden of proof is upon the tribunal to which the appellant makes his application. I desire to impress upon the committee my doubts as to whether either the amendment which this clause seeks to make in the principal act, or the amendment which the right honorable member for North Sydney has moved to this clause, goes quite as far as I want it to go, or probably as far as the right honorable member for North Sydney would want it to go. In perusing the clause, I find that proposed new section 39b provides - (1.) The commission, a board, an appeal tribunal and an assessment appeal tribunal in hearing, determining or deciding a claim, application or appeal, shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case-- 

Apart fromthe fact that it is a common rule applied to all tribunals, nothing new is added there - shall not be bound by technicalities or legal forms or rules of evidence-- 

The words in the original section were " shall not be bound by rules of evidence ", and the words " technicalities or legal forms or " really do not add anything. It goes on - and shall give to the claimant, applicant or appellant the benefit of any doubt - 

{: type="a" start="a"}
0. as to the existence of any fact, matter, cause or circumstance which would he favorable to the claimant, applicant or appellant; or 
1. as to any question whatsoever which arises for decision under his claim, application or appeal. 

In other words, what it does is to particularize, and it seems to me that the words " shall give to the claimant, applicant or appellant the benefit of any doubt " .would have been wide enough. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- In particularizing, there is no point that it does not cover, because it says " as to any question whatsoever It generalizes as well as particularizes. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- That is so. Proposed new section 39b continues - (2.) It shall not be necessary for the claimant, applicant or appellant to furnish conclusive proof- 

It has never been an obligation on the claimant, applicant or appellant to furnish conclusive proof, and I notice that the right honorable member for North Sydney has given notice of a further amendment to omit the word. " conclusive ". The proposed new section goes on - to support his claim, application or appeal, but the commission, board, appeal tribunal or assessment appeal tribunal determining or deciding the claim, application or appeal shall be entitled to draw, and shall draw from all the circumstances of the case, from the evidence furnished and from medical opinions, all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant, applicant or appellant- 

I suggest that the only words there which are material are "in favour of the claimant, applicant, or appellant". 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- And the word " all ", in the phrase "shall draw ... all reasonable inferences ". 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- The tribunal is obliged to draw all reasonable inferences, whether the section so provides or not. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- It says " shall draw ", not " may draw ". 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- The important words are " in f avour of the claimant, applicant or appellant". The section provides that the tribunal shall draw all reasonable inferences in favour of any person who makes a claim, application or appeal. The vital words are " shall draw in favour of the claimant, applicant or appellant all reasonable inferences ". That must necessarily leave a great deal of elasticity to the tribunal, and that is why I am directing myself to the concluding portion of the proposed new section, which, I think, is important. It goes on - and in all cases whatsoever the onus of proof shall lie on the person or authority who con tends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed. 

The amendment of the right honorable member for North Sydney, in detail, alters that portion by reason of its examination of the preceding sub-section 1, but does not alter its substantial character. The last part of proposed new subsection 2, if amended, would read - and in all cases whatsoever the onus of proof of any matter referred to in paragraphs  *(a)*  and (6) of the last preceding sub-section shall lie on the person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed. 

The right honorable member for North Sydney has had much longer experience in these matters than any one else in the committee, but I am told that the onus of proof section in the present act has given rise to many disputes. My anxiety is to cast upon the tribunal the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant's case should be rejected, and not merely the onus of proof, which is an elastic term and can be elastically interpreted by the  tribunal. I do this for the following very definite reason. I know, and every lawyer knows, that if we simply provide for the onus of proof in the act, the tribunal will say, " True, that is the onus of proof, but there is the evidence, and the conclusion we come to is so and so ". That is the approach made by tribunals. I do not think that gives to the soldiers the protection which is necessary. I apprehend that that is the view of the committee, and that we should force upon the tribunal the burden of excluding any other reasonable hypothesis for a. man's condition. Therefore, the amendment which I have circulated, and to which I draw the attention of the right honorable member for North Sydney, because it is not my desire to cut across his amendment at all, is put forward by me simply with the desire to make certain that the soldier is put in a position where the tribunal must, in reality, establish and affirm beyond reasonable doubt that his condition or incapacity has no relation to his war service. For that reason, I regard with the greatest concern the provisions of the bill. The right honorable member for 

North Sydney has, of course, not altered the question of the onus of proof. 

##### Mr Hughes:

--  That provision was originally put in by me. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- That is true; but I have reason to believe that it has not been interpreted in the way intended by the right honorable member. That is why I have drafted and circulated an amendment to leave out the words - 

  >The onus of proof shall lie on the person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed,  and to insert in their stead the following words : - 
  >
  >The person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed shall prove beyond reasonable doubt that the claim, application or appeal should not 'be fully or partially granted. 

I agree that that casts upon the commission an additional burden, and I intended that it should do so, because in my judgment the onus of proof provisions which appear in the act which we are now amending have proved to be insufficient. The onus of proof provisions in the act do not amount to a great deal when all the evidence has been taken, because the tribunal will say, "Yes, the onus of proof is upon either the appellant or the respondent, but there is the whole of the evidence, and, although we are enjoined by this section to draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant, we do not think that this is a reasonable inference in the circumstances ". There is too much elasticity in that respect, and for that reason we must impose upon the commission the obligation of proving its conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

--  Is not the tribunal in the nature of a respondent itself? 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- Yes. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

--  The onus of proof is placed on the commission which makes the decisioin and then has to satisfy itself that it has proved its case. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  Yes, beyond reasonable doubt. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- That is my proposal. The clause, apart from making a common rule applicable to all tribunals, makes no provision which is worth very much, and for that reason I seek to impose on the tribunal the obligation of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the claim should not be fully or partly granted, because, when a claimant goes to a tribunal and makes an application or appeal, the tribunal becomes, in effect, the respondent. I am seeking to make certain that its obligation shall be made quite clear - that it shall be for the commission to determine, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant is not entitled, either wholly or in part, to the relief which he claims. I consider that the matter is of some importance. 

##### Mr Brennan:

--  Does the honorable gentleman consider that the burden of proof is capable of being discharged in a considerable number of cases? 

Mi-. SPENDER. - Unquestionably. Under my amendment, the tribunal would have the obligation of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the claimant was not entitled to the relief which he was seeking. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

--  To whom would it have to establish that? 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- To itself. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

--  Any one can convince himself that he is right. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- That is true. That is what happens now under the requirement of the bare onus of proof. Without completely altering the framework of the act, I cannot see how more can be done than to tighten up the provision. I reply, with respect, to the honorable member for Batman  **(Mr. Brennan)**  that the burden of proof is capable of being discharged; because the commission will be acquainted of the details of the man's condition, and will have at its disposal all the medical advice. I can see no reason why it should not be told unequivocally that it must exclude any other reasonable hypothesis, and that, if it does not, it must grant the application either wholly or in part. I comprehend the difficulty mentioned by the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear).**  We must either leave the provision in its present form - which would not achieve our object - or tighten it up. It can be tightened only in the terms of my amendment, 

##### Dr EVATT:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; Barton &middot; ALP</small>

--  A case first comes before the Repatriation Commission. 

The first clause of the hill describes the duty of the commission - that it shall give to the claimant the benefit of any doubt as to any question whatsoever which arises for decision. That is the instruction of the Parliament. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- That applies to all the tribunals. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- I am commencing with the first, which is not an appeal tribunal. It is not a court of law, and there is no appeal from its decision to a court of law. ' The Parliament instructs the administrative tribunal to give to any member the benefit of any doubt as to any matter which may affect his claim. If the tribunal does its job satisfactorily, that direction is sufficient. It is made perfectly clear that that applies to every stage of the inquiry. The amendment of the honorable member for "Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  is self-contradictory. It provides that the authority shall prove beyond reasonable doubt that the claim should not be granted. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- That is the onus of proof. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- No. . I am speaking of the obligation that is placed on the commission. It has to determine whether or not liability exists. Where has it to prove beyond reasonable doubt before itself? 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- It has now to discharge the burdell of proof before itself. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- That illustrates the contradictions. There is no hearing, in the ordinary sense, before the commission in the first instance. It is the body which has to decide. It does not prove things as a court of law does. I appreciate the objective of the honorable member for Warringah. It is completely achieved by the bill, as amended at the instance of the right honorable member for North Sydney (Mv. Hughes). The matter cannot be. carried much farther so long as the tribunal honestly carries out the instruction of the Parliament; we insist that it will. Every doubt that arises in any portion of the case will be resolved in favour of the member. 

##### Mr Calwell:

-- Would not the provision be strengthened by the addition of the words "beyond reasonable doubt"? 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- No; because it says earlier that any doubt whatever in the case - it may be said to be either reasonable or unreasonable - shall be resolved in favour of the applicant. It may be said to go further than the amendment of the honorable member for Warringah, because that introduces the idea of " reasonable " doubt. I do not, however, elaborate that point. We are dealing with an administrative tribunal. We are reinforcing the object of administration, by reversing the practice in all such cases - instead of the onus being on the man to prove his claim, he is to be given the benefit of any doubt in every portion of the case. That is a direction by the Parliament to these bodies. They must carry it out. 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- They had the opportunity on a previous occasion, and did not avail themselves of it. In about one case in ten thousand did they change their view. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- A more definite obligation is now to be placed upon them. 

##### Mr Calwell:

-- It might be meaningless and valueless. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- I do not consider that it is either, or that it will be administered in that way. We are reinforcing the position by the provision, amended at the instance of the right honorable member for North Sydney, that in all cases the member shall be given the benefit of any doubt. 

I have dealt with the first tribunal. Let us now consider .the entitlement tribunal, which is the appeal board. There the position of. the commission is analogous to that of a litigant. In this instance, the onus will be on the commission, and the benefit of any doubt must again be given to the member. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- That has been the position. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- I am not satisfied that it has been stated so clearly. These are not matters for judicial determination, but are dealt with purely administratively. 

##### Mr Marwick:

-- It was the usual procedure under the act. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- It is being made stronger, in that the medical officers who deal with the case at any stage will have to state what doubts they have. These  statements will always be on record, and may be relied on by the soldier. He will be able to say " the doctor had a doubt, and it must be resolved in my favour ". Irrespective of what the medical man may say, both the commission and the appeal tribunal are being told by the Parliament, in this direct and absolute way, to give to the member the benefit of the doubt. 

##### Mr Rankin:

--  Will the appellant have the right to see the decision and the evidence? In the past his chance of doing so has been very slight. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- A further amendment is to be moved, dealing with the matter of new evidence. It deals more with reports from additional medical officers. I am confident that this improved provision will make the position in relation to the benefit of the doubt satisfactory. I am also confident that what the honorable member for Warringah seeks to obtain will be obtained in substance by the form of words that has been adopted. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  That provision is no different from the one in the present act. Where it is provided that the tribunal shall act according to the substantial justice and the merits of the case, it shall not be bound by the rules of evidence, and shall give to the applicant the benefit of any doubt. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- Any doubt as to what? That is the point. We propose to make it clear that the direction shall cover any possible fact or circumstance that might assist the claimant in his case. We also make it clear that the onus of proof shall be reversed, and we provide, in regard to medical evidence, machinery by which the applicant may take advantage of the provision. This amendment makes certain that, before the commission, the Entitlement Tribunal and the Assessment Tribunal, the applicant shall be in a better position than he was 'before. 

##### Mr Morgan:

--  Does the Government propose to accept all the amendments of the right honorable member for North Sydney ? 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- Yes. All of them, except the first, are consequential. All facts which would be favorable to the applicant must be resolved in his favour if any possible doubt exists. 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wentworth</small>

-- We wish to make certain the applicant shall receive the benefit of any doubt that exists. All honorable members have had experience of cases in which it would appear that the applicant was not given the benefit of the doubt. I have here particulars of one case in which a man was refused a pension, and I should like to know if, under the new provision, his case may be re-opened. This man was invalided from France to Britain, and from Britain to Australia, with a heart disability, which was recognized during the period from 1918 to 1921. According to the commission, the disability had evaporated by 1933, and was non-existent in 1938, yet in 1940 it returned in the form of total incapacity. The man lost his pension because of his failure to report for medical examination. When the condition returned, and it was established that he was totally incapacitated, his claim for a pension was refused. It would certainly appear that he did not receive the. benefit of the doubt. Of course, it may be that he was penalized because of his failure to report for examination. I believe there is such a provision in the act. However, that should not preclude him from consideration now that his disability has returned. The onus should rest upon the commission to prove that his present incapacity is not associated with his former condition. It is not surprising that honorable members, with a knowledge of cases of this kind, desire to put it beyond question that the onus of proof shall rest upon the commission, and that the applicant shall receive the benefit of any doubt that may exist. As honorable members are aware, the commission has files dealing with the cases of applicants, and on these files are confidential documents, including the soldier's medical history from the time of his enlistment. The applicant has no right to examine these papers, nor to know the grounds upon which his application is refused. The commission has the right to challenge the evidence submitted in favour of the applicant, and to examine witnesses called by him. On the other hand, the soldier has no right to challenge any evidence which may be submitted by the commission, or  examine any of the witnesses. The commission has the right to legal aid, but the soldier is precluded from obtaining such aid. 

##### Mr Brennan:

-- Does the Entitlement Tribunal, in the case cited, hold that the present condition of total incapacity is not due to war service? 

##### Mr HARRISON:

-- Yes. Having already paid a pension to the soldier, it says that the total incapacity due to heart trouble is not attributable to war service, because the old disability has cleared up in the intervening years, and that the present incapacity is due to a new form of heart trouble. I do not know how that could happen. Something must be done to give to the soldier an even break. If the onus of proof is established beyond all reasonable doubt, we shall have achieved what we set out to do. This matter should have serious consideration, as it is the basis of justice to all returned soldiers. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:<br><small class="text-muted">Dalley</small>

.- This is the most vital clause in the bill. The Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt)**  has said that it is an improvement on the section of the principal act now proposed to be repealed. It would be a very poor provision if it were not an improvement on that section. Much of the complaint about the operation of the present act has relation to the onus of proof, and the proposed new provisions are merely an empty gesture. There appears to be only one way of establishing the onus of proof, and that is to set up a tribunal in such a form that the soldier will be the applicant, the tribunal will be the respondent, and somebody else will determine the onus of proof. It seems to me that all of the words following the first paragraph of the proposed new section 39b are unnecessary. The proposed new section states - 

{: type="1" start="1"}
0. The commission, a board, an appeal tribunal and an assessment appeal tribunal, in hearing, determining or deciding a claim, application or appeal, shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case . . 

We need not go further than that. If the commission acts according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, the onus of proof goes by the board. If the case has merits, the tribunal will decide in favour of the applicant, and, if the case is without merits, it will be decided against him. The Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt)**  has laid stress on one or two points, one being that the applicant must get the benefit of any doubt. What exactly creates a doubt, as contemplated in the proposed new section? I know cases in which several doctors have declared a soldier to be suffering from a particular disability, but when another doctor has ultimately reported that he is not suffering from that trouble, -the evidence of that doctor has on more than one occasion been accepted in preference to that of all of the others. Apparently the commission was waiting for a victory, and it immediately deprived the soldier of his pension. In cases such as I have mentioned, those who determine whether there is a doubt are the members of the commission. It may say that there is no doubt. It has decided, in the first place, whether a doubt exists and it then determines whether the benefit of the doubt can be given. The proposed amendment circulated by the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  is as follows : - 

  >That the words " the onus of proof shall lie on the person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed ", be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words : " the person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed shall prove beyond reasonable doubt that the claim, application or appeal should not be fully or partly granted ". 

When a soldier makes an application to the commission, who will decide whether there is a reasonable doubt and on whom lies the onus of proof? The commission would have the right, in the first place, to say whether there was a doubt, and, secondly, it would have to convince itself that it had established the onus of proof. That is rather one-sided. We have the remarkable position that the respondent, who is instructed to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt, has itself established the onus of proof, and the same authority is in the invidious position of having to decide whether it had established the onus of proof. So the commission has to be the respondent and also the judge as to whether the  onus of proof has been established. It appears to me that practically every case in which there is the slightest element of doubt will go beyond the commission to the various appeal tribunals, with the result that the hearing of the claims of soldiers will be considerably lengthened. When a matter reaches the appeal tribunal, the soldier will be in a less favorable position than before, because the commission will have satisfied itself that it has proved that he is not entitled to the pension. The matter then passes to another tribunal, similarly constituted, but, before it reaches that tribunal, the soldier is already handicapped by the fact that the commission has satisfied itself that he is not entitled to the pension. 

##### Sir George Bell:

--  Why does the honorable member call that a handicap? 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- Because the assumption is. that, as under the bill, the commission has the right to give to the applicant the benefit of any reasonable doubt, and is also accorded the right to determine the onus of proof, the decision will go against him. The case then goes to the Appeal Tribunal, with the man under the handicap that another body has established to its satisfaction that the facts are against him. The commission and all the other boards and tribunals before which the man may appear are required to give him the benefit of reasonable doubt; but decision as to what constitutes reasonable doubt rests with the commission, the board or the tribunal. The commission, board or tribunal is .required to establish the fact that the man is not entitled to the pension which he is claiming,, or grant the claim; but- the question of onus of proof has not been by any means settled, because the commission, board or tribunal itself decides whether it has discharged the onus of proof. The returned soldiers will not benefit from the transfer of the onus of proof to the commission unless the tribunals established under the principal act are reconstituted. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  Because of their character?' 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- Yes. We are trying to graft a new limb on to an old tree. A civil case in which there is a. claimant and a respondent is decided by a third party, and one side or the other has to  prove its case to the satisfaction of that third party; but that principle is not followed in repatriation matters because from the first tribunal to the last, regardless of where the onus of proof lies, the tribunal, which is the respondent, decides the case. There is need to recast the whole system in order that when the claimant, the returned soldier, and the respondent, the commission, are at variance the facts shall be decided on merit by a third party. Neither the bill nor the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  gets over the outstanding difficulty that the commission, one of the parties, decides whether it has discharged the onus of proof which is cast upon it. I submit that it is not difficult for any tribunal which has the decision to establish to its own. satisfaction that it is right and the soldier is wrong. Until we deal satisfactorily with this situation, all the other conditions prescribed in this bill will go by the board, and there will be as many thousands of injustices done to returned soldiers after this war, when the commission will have to discharge the onus of proof, as there were after the last war, when the- onus of proof was on the soldier. 

##### Mr RANKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bendigo</small>

.- I also am very worried about this matter of onus of proof. Two or three years ago we inserted in the Repatriation Act a provision transferring, as we thought, the onus of proof from the soldier to the commission. We believed then that we had really succeeded in doing something of inestimable value to returned soldiers; but we were misled by the people who framed the amendment. There was a legal loophole. The old story that law is made by doubtful lawyers for the benefit of doubtful lawyers still holds good.- 

##### Mr Brennan:

--  The whole trouble is that Parliament is endeavouring to get away from established legal practice, and is consequently finding itself in a morass. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- We could not get into a worse morass than that into which lawyers have put us in the last 150 years. Lawyers appearing in court have never been known in any circumstances to  agree. Ho-w would they exist if they did ? Why, it would be one of the most  unpopular  professions in the world. 

##### Mr Brennan:

-- Politicians do not seem to agree very well. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- And when we have a mixture of lawyers and politicians the position is worse. That is not the point that is worrying me. What I am worried about is . whether the returned soldiers suffering war disabilities and their dependants will receive a fairer deal than they have hitherto received. The repatriation legislation and regulations are framed in such a way that it has been practically impossible for disabled returned soldiers to receive fair treatment. Any man appearing before a repatriation tribunal should be entitled to know the evidence against him; but no man is able, owing to the way the law stands, to know what has been adduced against him on the medical side. He is merely told that the tribunal has decided against him. He is just wiped off. How can a man or his representative rebut evidence when he does not know what that evidence is? Some of the decisions of the Repatriation Commission have been a scandal, an absolute disgrace to Australia. 

##### Mr Blackburn:

-- The High Court dealt with one case, and the AttorneyGeneral  **(Dr. Evatt)**  was a member of the court.! 

Ur. Evatt. - That was Bott's case. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- That may be. I know of one nian who was gassed in the last war. He was sent out of the firing line for three months, and the facts were recorded on. his medical history sheet. He then returned to the line and fought till the armistice. He then returned to Australia. Nine or ten years later, when some of those who knew the facts were dead and others scattered far and wide in Australia, he developed tuberculosis in the throat and died, leaving a widow and a large family.  His  medical history card, of course, was still available. He had a reasonable case. Any man except a doctor or some legal-minded gentleman would agree that he died from the effect of injuries which he received in the war. He had nearly five years" service. He had married a fine woman, and when he became ill, she, with the aid of their child of ten years, cultivated their irrigation block in northern Victoria. Since then, the man has died, and the tribunal and the legal-minded gentlemen can do him no further wrong. But he has left a widow and children, and they are entitled to consideration. If we agree to a clause which does not place the onus of proof on the appeal tribunal, I can only say that we are not giving a fair deal to these people. I- hope that in this chamber there are sufficient honorable members who have the interests ' of the soldier so much at heart that this matter shall be put beyond all doubt on this occasion. We have been bluffed twice, but we shall not be bluffed a third time. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Batman</small>

.- I have the utmost sympathy with .the object which the honorable member for Bendigo  **(Mr. Rankin)**  has in view. This is certainly a golden opportunity for practical, ordinary, simpletinminded men to draw up in plain language provisions which will indisputably have the effect that he desires. If the honorable gentleman will submit to the committee his proposals in a few words of crystalclear English, I shall support him. 

##### Sir Charles Marr:

-- Perhaps the honorable gentleman himself would suggest the words. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:

-- I must not suggest them. I am a humble worker in that field which is anathema to the honorable gentleman. I want the words to come from a man who is accustomed to say " Come ", and he  cometh,  or " Go ", and he  goeth,  so that there shall be no misunderstanding about what is meant. I want the honorable gentleman's intention to be expressed in plain English. I do not desire that this clause shall be confused in the sinuous intricacies of legalminded persons whose livings depend upon creating verbal difficulties. 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- I agree with the honorable member. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:

-- The honorable gentleman wants to get rid of these persons ; he wants matters set out in plain English. This is his opportunity. I ask him to express in- plain English what I understand he desires, namely, that any soldier who, having been accepted, after examination, as being a person fit to serve in the onerous and responsible duties of soldiering, and afterwards contracts a disease, shall have the benefit of the doubt to such a degree that it shall not be open to argument that his present disease and present difficulty are due to his war service. 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- No. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:

-- "Would not the honorable member go so far as that? 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- No. I want to ensure that if a man contracts a disease which might normally be expected to arise from his war service, the commission must prove that it did not arise from his service. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- That is what the clause provides. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:

-- It was precisely that object which the draftsman had in view when he framed this new clause; and it was precisely that object which the draftsman had in view when he framed the prior clause which this clause seeks to displace. 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- His mind had a legal twist. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:

-- There is no question of a legal twist. There are few lawyers in the chamber, and they can easily be suppressed. ' I am certain that the Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt)**  would be delighted to go to bed and leave in the hands of his highly practical colleagues, the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  and the honorable member for Bendigo  **(Mr. Rankin),**  the task of formulating the necessary plain English to deal with this matter. Having that object in view, the principal act provided, in section 39b, that - 

  >Subject to this Act, the Commission shall, in the determination of appeals, act according to substantial justice and to the merits of each case, and shall give to an appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt. Those words are repeated in the new clause, with the exception that the word " reasonable " is left out, the assumption being, as the Attorney-General has already pointed out, that the soldier is to get the benefit of any reasonable or unreasonable doubt. The truth of the matter is, as I said by way of interjection 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- The honorable member wants to have an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:

-- I do not want an appeal. I am in the same position as is the honorable member for Bendigo. I am just as anxious as he is that these men should receive proper treatment. 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- I agree that that is so. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:

-- I am just as anxious as he is that these unfortunate persons, who are labouring under some kind of disability, shall be able to secure a pension, or a continuation of their pension, or an increase of their pension. However, we have proceeded along the lines of asking the tribunal to act " according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, and not be bound by technicalities or legal forms or rules of evidence, and give to the claimant, applicant or appellant the benefit of any doubt ". In adopting those words we have cast aside the experience of well nigh 200 years. It is time that some one arose in this Parliament to declare publicly that the notion that justice is hampered by the rules of law and of evidence by lawyers for the purpose of serving the interests of the lawyers, is all "bosh". 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- Hear, hear ! 

##### Mr BRENNAN:

-- I am quite sure that the right honorable gentleman is not jesting, and that he realizes that we are attempting by the language of this clause to jettison the experience of the most eminent law-makers and justice-givers associated with the growth of British jurisprudence. So we speak in these vague terms, that we shall cast aside all these legal technicalities and shall get to the substantial justice of the case; and the result of our best efforts is that we land in this Serbonian Bog of Difficulties which commonly arise from the  flounderings  of those who are not experienced in the use of clear English to express a plain idea. Ask the man in the street to express a proposition in plain English and, immediately, you will set up an argument each expressing in different language his idea of what he means by plain English. 

##### Mr Menzies:

-- Like section 92 of the Constitution. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:

-- Yes ; that is a good example of plain English about which honest men disagree, and about which, it is true, they have had to hire lawyers to help them out. I" thought it necessary just to unload a few sentiments on that point, because they are entirely relevant to this very complicated and difficult clause. However, I think that laboriously, and with much complication, we have succeeded in conveying to the tribunal the very evident desire of the Parliament - and, on the whole, I am inclined to applaud it for so doing - that the tribunal shall exercise its quasi- judicial functions a bit loaded against its better judgment in favour of the soldier. I use the word " quasi " with trepidation in the presence of the honorable member for Bendigo, because one does not know how he will regard an expression of such doubtful origin. I hope that the tribunal will so exercise its functions ; but I think that we are making' it difficult for it to do so. As the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear)**  pointed out, the tribunal, in the last resort, must decide the vexed question whether it has discharged the onus of proof. So, all our labours serve the somewhat ridiculous purpose of showing that we have overlaid this proposition with a great deal of superfluous language which has served the very purpose which the honorable member for Bendigo so strenuously desires to avoid, and which is entirely the work, not of lawyers, but of men like himself. 

The honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison)**  gave an illustration to which I listened with very great attention. He cited the case of a man who had served in the war of 1914-18 and had developed heart trouble of some description. We know that there are many diseases of the heart. That man drew a pension in respect of his heart trouble. Eventually, to use the language of the commission, that trouble " evaporated ", and the disease ceased to exist. I sympathize with the honorable member for Wentworth in respect of that case. He pointed out that that soldier, after having drawn a pension for some sort of cardiac disease, was declared cured, and went about his business, but later had a complete breakdown from heart disease. Whether it was the same -disease, I do not know; but in respect of it he had been refused a pension. I can only express the hope that the tribunal will accept the language of this clause, as it is now supported by the Attorney-General, as a broad hint, at least - and, perhaps, there is nothing more in it than that - that in such a case the pension should be renewed and continued. One cannot hope for more than that. I have very little confidence in this jargon; but I hope that, with sympathetic administrators of this law, we shall obtain substantial and just results for the soldiers in spite of the plain English of the gentlemen who, unfortunately, do not always know what plain English is. 

##### Sir GEORGE BELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Darwin</small>

-- Our most difficult problem in respect of this subject is to express ourselves in language to explain that we want the soldier to get the benefit of the doubt when the commission is considering whether he is entitled to a pension because he has suffered from some disability due to war service. After all, what is a doubt? Of course, no doubt arises when a man suffered injuries which necessitated an amputation. But all cases are not so clear as that. Sometimes it happens that years after a soldier has been discharged from the Army he becomes ill and claims that his indisposition is due to war service. He may be examined by the most eminent doctors in the land, and a doubt would remain in their minds. But honorable members are now trying so to phrase thi3 provision as to make it perfectly clear that the onus of proof that a man is not entitled to a pension because his disability is not due to his war service, shall rest with the Repatriation Commission. How can it possibly be proved ? It cannot be proved. The language which is used in the bill will make little or no difference. to the phraseology of the act. The act provides that the commission shall, in the determination of appeals, give to an appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt. The bill declares that the commission shall give to the claimant the benefit of any doubt. What is the difference between a " reasonable doubt " and a " doubt " ? We have to depend upon the Repatriation Commission, ana it consists of reasonable men, who are sympathetic to the soldier, and desire  *Ugive*  to him the benefit of any doubt. It any doubt exists in their mind, he will get  the benefit of it. At any rate, I have no doubts in the matter. 

I have had as much experience of war pensions as any other honorable member, and I am convinced that nine men receive a pension, although their disability cannot be proved to be due to war service, for every man who is suffering a disability due to war service, whose application is rejected. The Repatriation Commission consists of men who want to grant a pension to the soldier if it is possible for them to do so. The honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear)**  contended that the only remedy is to recast the tribunal. That will not make the slightest difference. No doubt can exist regarding a disability when the soldier first returns from the war. The difficulty arises when he lodges a claim many years afterwards. If he had never previously applied for a pension, no board of doctors can be sure whether his illness was due to, or aggravated by, his war service. The matter rests with the tribunal, which does not consist of men who must determine the claim on legal grounds. They are plain, ordinary, intelligent men who are sympathetic to the application of the soldier, and want to perform their duties in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the act. No new words that this committee can insert in the act can alter it to any degree, because the onus of proof already rests with the Repatriation Commission and the tribunals. Of course, they will not be able to prove definitely .that a disability is not due to war service. In some cases a very grave doubt may exist, but still the soldier will get the pension. It is not possible for us so to amend the act as to make the position clearer than it is now. The tribunal has been most competent in the past, a.nd new tribunals, if appointed, will consist of reasonable men, who, without, prejudice, will interpret the will of this Parliament. The issue is whether a man is suffering from a war disability, which has affected his health, because he served in the war. After obtaining the best advice from' medical practitioners, the tribunal will have one simple question to decide. I agree with the remarks of the honorable member for Batman  **(Mr. Brennan)**  that the interpretation of words does not enter into the question. 

The whole matter will depend upon the decision of men of ability and sound judgment.

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

-- Any one with experience of the dealing - with claims by tribunals will, I think, agree that in the great majority of cases no exception can be taken to the decisions made by the deciding authority, whether it be the board, the commission or the appeal tribunal; but that does not mean that in every case the deciding body proceeds to follow the lines set for it by the act of Parliament. Probably all the members of the board, the commission and the appeal tribunal are soldiers. One member of the board must be a person nominated by returned soldiers, and one member of the commission must be the same, and probably all the members of the commission are, whilst two members of the appeal tribunal must be returned soldiers, the third being a lawyer. It does appear that the members of these bodies say to themselves : " Well, we are returned soldiers, and we have the capacity to judge the merits' of returned soldiers' claims, and an insight into the returned soldier character which other people do not possess, and whatever the legislation says, we are going to do what we consider substantial justice ". An illustration of that is the case referred to in this chamber some years ago, .which led to the amendment being made in section 42w. That is the well-known case which went to the High Court in relation to a returned soldier named Bott. Bott had contracted rheumatism while on war service,- and later received a pension for a chronic rheumatic condition. That pension was cancelled, and Bott made several ineffectual attempts to regain it. He then applied for an invalid pension, a fact which is material to what I shall say afterwards, and went to hospital. He applied again for his pension on the advice which he received from the medical man who examined him, and, being refused,, went to the appeal tribunal. What happened at the appeal tribunal was very interesting. The Commonwealth medical referee  gave evidence, and the doctor from the hospital, who examined Bott, also gave evidence on his behalf, but the  opposers  refused to cross-examine. I quote the following from the judgment of  **Mr. Justice**  Evatt, now the right honorable the Attorney-General, reported in 50  *O.L.R.,*  253:- 

  >On the 24th February, 1933, the applicant waa represented upon his appeal to the respondents by  **Mr. T.**  W. McLaren. He called two medical witnesses. The first was  **Dr. H.**  J. W. Brennand,  Commonwealth Medical Referee for Invalid Pensions. He was duly sworn, and stated that not only was the applicant suffering from chronic rheumatism, but he was actually receiving an invalid pension on account of that very condition. Asked whether the condition was referable to the rheumatic fever which the applicant had contracted at Gallipoli in 1915,  **Dr.**  Brennand  said, " Yes, definitely, it is related to the old trouble ". The  chairman, Colonel Ralston,  asked  **Dr. Brennand**  if he hod seen the appellant's war history, and the reply was " No ". The  chairman  then turned to  **Dr. Kenneth**  Smith, who -was present on behalf of the Repatriation Commission, and inquired if he desired to ask  **Dr. Brennand**  any question.  **Dr. Smith**  replied "No". 
  >
  >
 **Dr.** Brennand's  evidence was corroborated by  **Dr. J.**  E. Sherwood- 


 **Dr. Sherwood** was the doctor who had examined Bott at the public hospital - in the essential respects, namely (1) a present condition of chronic rheumatism, and (2) a definite medical relation between that condition and the contraction of rheumatic fever at Gallipoli. Again, the Repatriation Commission's representative, though invited by the  chairman  to cross-examine the witness, asked no questions. In these circumstances, it is obvious that the applicant had made a " prima facie case " within the meaning of the proviso to section 45w (2). 

Nevertheless, the commission decided that Bott had not made a prima facie case. He had attended two doctors, each of whom said that he had this condition, and each of whom attributed it to war service, and the representative of the Repatriation Commission declined to cross-examine either doctor, but, in spite of all that, the Repatriation Commission said that a prima facie case had not been made out. What, of course, appears is that the tribunal thought that the man was not really entitled to a pension, and it was not going to allow the words of the section to stand in the way of its refusal to give him a pension, and so it did refuse to give him one. I suggest to honorable members who have not read the decision in that case that they should read it, because the tribunal's conduct absolutely deprives any one who reads the report of any confidence in the will of these tribunals to follow the direction of an act of Parliament. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">REID, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- That is a good reason why there should be some appeal. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- Of course these tribunals were created for the purpose of giving appeals, and they are manned by returned soldiers. On the appeal tribunal two of the members must be returned soldiers, and I understand that in fact all three of them are. Nevertheless, they disregard the language of the section when it prevents them from doing what they think that they ought to do. They say: "It does not matter what the act says; here is a man who we think should not get a pension, and we are not going to allow the language of the act to force us to give him one ". I prefer the language of the draft of the honorable member for Warringah to the language used by the act or by this clause, but I am very much afraid that, whatever words we put into the section, we shall, not be able to ensure that the appeal tribunals and the commission will obey the direction of Parliament. ' First. we free them from being bound by the rules of evidence, and the technical rules of law, and then we give them certain directions. To my mind the great advantage of the proposal of the honorable member for Warringah is that it does propose to change the formula. We have had a formula, and we have seen it disregarded by the men charged with the administration of it. It may be said that these words are polarized, that they have acquired a certain relation to other words and a certain unnatural meaning, and that the commission, if they still stand, will say: " We disregarded them before and we are going to disregard them again ". The words proposed by the honorable member for Warringah are more explicit than the old words, and for that reason I think that they are preferable. Sub-section 2 of the proposed new section, if amended in the way which the honorable member proposes, would, read - 

{: type="1" start="2"}
0. It shall not be necessary for the claimant, applicant or appellant to furnish conclusive proof to support his claim, application or appeal but the commission, board. appeal tribunal or assessment appeal tribunal determining or deciding the claim, application or appeal shall be entitled to draw, and shall draw, from all the circumstances of the case, from) the evidence furnished and from medical opinions, all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant, applicant or appellant, and in all cases whatsoever- and here I come to the words which the honorable member proposes to insert - the person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed shall prove beyond reasonable doubt that the claim, application or appeal should not be fully or partly granted. 

There we are getting explicit English words instead of the legal phrase "the onus of proof ". I prefer the explicit English words which the honorable member for Warringah proposes to put into the clause to the repetition of a' legal phrase, the use of which has not secured the result which it was intended to secure. 

##### Mr Morgan:

-- Would the honorable member retain the words " onus of proof " ? 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- I would not. I have read the section as the honorable member for Warringah proposes to amend it. I believe that it. would be much harder for the board, commission, or tribunal to ignore the language used by the honorable member for Warringah than to ignore the language of the present section or of the proposed new section contained in the clause. The proposed new section retains the phrase " onus of proof ". The use of that phrase has failed to secure the results which this Parliament intended to secure, and I believe that it would be much better to depart from it and to use the plain English words which the honorable member for Warringah has circulated. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

.The discussion that has taken place on this clause would not have arisen but for the general dissatisfaction caused by the administration of the act. As the honorable member for Warringah has pointed out, the act as previously framed placed a strong onus of proof on the Commission. In fact, section 45w provided that it was sufficient in making out a prima facie case for the applicant merely to aver " that the incapacity or death of the soldier- resulted from an occurrence hap pening during the period he was a member of the forces or from his employment in connexion with naval or military preparations or operations ". That is the simplest form of proof that could be laid down; yet there has been widespread dissatisfaction as to the manner in which the act has been administered. It would appear that that section has been honoured more in the breach than in the observance. The debate has disclosed the existence of a belief that, despite the present proposal, the administration may not be in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the act. Therefore, the matter should be made as plain as possible. I cannot see why such eminent lawyers as the Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt),**  the honorable members for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  and Bourke   **(Mr. Blackburn),**  and others cannot frame a provision that would give satisfaction to all parties. The desire of all is that it shall be made as plain as possible, in order to ensure that the spirit of the act shall he observed. It would appear that many of the claims that are coming before the department from returned soldiers of the present war are being rejected, although those men have been discharged from the Army because of medical unfitness. The particulars given to me disclose that, at the 31st December, 1942, there had been before the Repatriation Commission 39,853 claims, arising from the present war, for pensions by ex-members of the services or their dependants. Of that total, 5,050 claims by members had been granted and 5,998 had been rejected; and 12,735 claims by dependants had been granted, and 10,633 had been rejected; the totals being 17,785 granted, and 16,631 rejected. Therefore, it is essential that this provision shall be in the clearest terms. There would seem to be quite a prejudice against lawyers having a voice in the matter. They will not have a dominating voice in the administration, as only the  chairman  of the tribunal will be a lawyer. Medical men will have considerable influence in the administration of the act, as they have had in the past. Complaint has arisen not so much because of the repatriation administration as because of the domination of the administration by the medical assessors who, from time to time, give opinions in regard to disabilities. 

I wish to refer to another portion of clause 18, which, if allowed to remain in its present form, will merely perpetuate the condition that has given rise to complaints. Proposed new section 39c provides - (1.) A medical practitioner shall, in reporting on any claim in relation to a member of the forces, set out in his report his opinion - 

{: type="a" start="a"}
0. in the case of a claim in respect of the death of the member - as to the cause of the death; and 
1. in the case of a claim in respect of the incapacity of the member - as to the nature, cause and extent of the incapacity. 

The medical man is not to give reasons for his opinion, except when he entertains a doubt. It is the function of the tribunal to give a finding as to the actual cause of death or incapacity. It is now proposed that the medical officer shall practically decide the cause of death or incapacity, although the whole of the data and history may not have been before him. In the case mentioned by the honorable member for Bourke, the doctor was asked by the  chairman  of the tribunal whether he knew the history of the case, and he replied that he did not. How can a. medical officer give a definite opinion without a knowledge of the whole of the facts and circumstances? He should be required to state his reasons, so that his opinion may be tested against the opinions of other medical men. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- If he gives his opinion honestly he will also give his reasons for it. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- Why not make that provision ? 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- When a court gives an opinion, it generally gives its reasons for it. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- It does. I am asking that that practice shall be followed in these cases. There are medical officers who make positive statements. Decisions conveyed to claimants forpensions have stated baldly that, in the opinion of the commission, the disability is not due to war service. As medical men are to be required to take a more important place in these matters, they should at least give reasons for their decisions, so that they may be tested. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- This is only a starting point. If a doctor has doubts, he must state them. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- Many medical men are positive in their opinions. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- Even a positive opinion will not bind either the commission or, on appeal, the board. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- Usually, evidence is given not orally, but by means of a certificate. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- If additional medical opinion is obtained, it must be brought to the notice of the member. The honorable member is viewing the matter too narrowly and technically. For the first time, the doctors will have to state their doubts and give written reasons for them. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- Only when a doubt is entertained. If a doctor has not a doubt, he will not have to state the nature and degree of it. 

##### Mr Hughes:

-- All this was done previously, but it was not mandatory; it was not provided for in the statute. The tribunal always looked at the opinion of the doctor, and it always carried weight. All that is being done now is to incorporate it in the law. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- It has not been the practice to state the grounds on which the opinion is based. A doctor will be able to give the opinion that the disability is not due to war service. 

##### Mr Frost:

-- The opinion is always available to the tribunal. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- But the opinion of the doctor cannot be tested ! If medical certificates are to be accepted as evidence, there ought to be provision for the testing of that opinion against other medical opinion. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- The commission is to be told to give the benefit of all doubt to the applicant. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- But the medical man who makes the report may not have any doubt; his idea may be positive. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- The medical man on the opposite side may have as positive an opinion in the other direction. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- Medical men form positive opinions, which cannot be challenged in the absence of specific reasons for them. I have had brought to my notice the case of a returned soldier of the present war. He has written to me stating that he and about 30 others, all returnees from this war, who have been discharged with chest trouble, have been told that they must have had the complaint .upon enlistment. His letter continues - 

  >My first medical board on enlistment for the Australian Imperial Force consisted of two doctors, J. Bedford El,vell and John Powell, both specialists on the Repatriation Board. I did five months intensive training at Redbank, Queensland, before embarking for the Middle East. After five months in Palestine and Egypt I was returned to Australia as medically unfit with asthma and  emphyema 
  >
  >On applying for medical treatment after discharge I was told that I was not entitled to it as my complaint was not due to, or aggravated by, war service. Also  **Dr. Minde**  of Brisbane, who by the way has not examined me, stated that in his opinion I must have been at least .65 per cent, disabled before enlistment. 
  >
  >In a speech given by  **Mr. Spender**  when he was Minister for the Army, at a recruiting rally, he stated that with the machinery at the Army's disposal (X-rays and such) no man would be able to enlist unless absolutely Al and therefore the onus would be on the Government to provide for any .man invalided back from overseas. 
  >
  >Before enlistment I followed heavy work, such as quarry labourer and bridge rigging, but since my discharge I am unable to do heavy work, and I have not worked a full week yet and it is costing me upwards of £1 for medicine and treatment every week and so my wife and children are being made to suffer, having to go without things they badly need. 

Apparently, the commission acted on the opinion of a medical officer who had not even examined the returned soldier. Evidence of that nature should not be presented to or accepted by the commission unless it can be tested. Opinion given in that bald way should be entirely discarded. If provision is made that the report of a medical man may be accepted in the manner laid down, at least there should be the requirement that reasons for the opinion shall be stated. I should like the honorable member for "Warringah to confer with the AttorneyGeneral, in order to ensure that the terms shall be as specific as it is possible .to make them. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- The amendment of the right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes)**  does not cut across that which I intend to move; it relates to another subject. I regard the subject-matter of my amendment as so important, that I propose to divide the committee on it. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- In our view, all that the honorable member wants is covered by the clause. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- I have attempted to make it clear that there is practically no difference between the clause and the provision in the act. The words already in the act are " determination of appeal ", "shall act according to substantial justice " shall not be bound by rules of evidence ", .and, " shall give to the claimant, applicant or appellant, the benefit of any doubt ". 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- In relation to what body ? 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- In relation to the appeal tribunal. But that does not matter, because we are dealing with the onus of proof. All that this does is to extend to all tribunals the existing provision regarding the onus of proof. That is not the point upon which we have been deliberating; therefore, it is. quite idle to make that objection. The last three lines of sub-section 2 have been lifted in their entirety from the act.- They are as follows: - 

  >And in all cases whatsoever the onus of proof shall lie on the person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal shall not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed. 

It is idle, therefore, to expect the committee to be satisfied that any substantial change is proposed. It is merely proposed to extend to all the tribunal's the provision in regard to onus of proof. The arguments submitted by the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  should convince the Government of the need to accept the amendment. The fact is, that the Government is sitting tight. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- Nothing of the kind. I have been in conference with the right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes),**  and we have agreed to tighten up the provision still further. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- I say that the right honorable member's amendment does not touch the matter. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- That is merely what the honorable member asserts. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- The amendment merely repeats the words in the present act. I am seeking to make it clear beyond any doubt where the obligation shall rest. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- It is clear enough now to any reasonable person. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- It is not clear to me nor, apparently, to the honorable member for Bourke. I propose to divide the committee on my amendment.

Clause further verbally amended. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

.- This clause limits unduly the grounds of appeal to an entitlement tribunal. I believe that there should be an appeal in all cases in which a claim has been refused by the Repatriation Commission or by an assessment tribunal. Pot instance, it is provided that no appeal shall lie when the disability is due to the wilful act of the claimant. Section 45at of the act defines active service. It is within the province of the commission to say whether the disability is such that it shall be deemed to have been contracted in actual contact with the enemy. Clause 33 amends section 45au - of the principal act by providing that upon the incapacity or death of a member of the forces, whose incapacity or death has resulted from an occurrence happening during the period from the date of his enlistment to the date of the termination of his service, and upon the incapacity or death of any member of the forces, whose incapacity or death has arisen out of, or is attributable to, his service, the Commonwealth shall be liable to pay the pension to him. But, if the death is, in the opinion of the commission, due to venereal disease contracted during -his period of service, the Commonwealth shall be liable to pay pensions to his widow and children. There, again, the matter is left entirely to the opinion of the commission, and. that is a state of mind from which there can be no appeal to the tribunal. Clause 33 further provides that the incapacity or death of a member shall be deemed to have arisen out of his service as a member, if it was the result of an accident which happened to him while travelling directly to or from his place of employment, or was, in the opinion of the commission, due to an accident occurring or to the contraction of a disease or an infection which would not have occurred or been contracted but for his being a member of the forces, or but for changes in his environment consequent upon his being such a member. There, again, the matter is left entirely to the opinion of the commission, and, as I have already said, there can be no appeal from a state of mind of the commission. 

I contend that there should be an appeal in all cases. Instead of setting out the cases in which there can be an appeal, an appeal to the tribunal should be allowed in all instances where a claim has been refused by the. commission. There should also be an appeal from the assessment tribunal. The assessment of claims has been the subject of many complaints. The entitlement tribunal has no jurisdiction with regard to claims; it merely decides whether an applicant is entitled to the pension. Then the matter goes back to the commission, which follows the decision given before the soldier is discharged from the Army. The Army Discharging Board states whether certain disabilities are due to war service, and mentions other disabilities which may not be due to war service. It specifies the rate of pension payable by a mathematical calculation. That is why soldiers sometimes receive paltry pensions amounting to a few shillings a week. The decisions of the War Pensions Entitlement Tribunal are frustrated because of this procedure. The matter should not be left to the Army Discharging Board. Assessments may have been made on a wrong principle, and contrary to the spirit and letter of the act, yet there is no appeal to the entitlement tribunal with regard to the assessment. The tribunal should have the final voice with regard to both the entitlement and the amount of the pension. The honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  has shown that there should be no obstacle to claimants obtaining complete justice. He cited an instance of gross injustice in which the matter was taken to the High Court, but apparently that court had no jurisdiction to deal with it. There was no appeal against a decision which was contrary to all principles of common justice. The Government should consider whether it would not be fair, in all cases in which the claimant is dissatisfied with the decision of the assessment tribunal, that there should be a general right of appeal to the entitlement tribunal, instead of appeals being limited to certain cases. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">PARKES, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; NAT; UAP from 1931</small>

--  I support the contention of the honorable member for Reid  **(Mr. Morgan).**  After an inquiry by the entitlement tribunal, and after a verdict of entitlement is obtained by the applicant, the application goes back to the commission, which then has power to say, "We are now bound to admit the entitlement, but the disability is nil ". 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  The commission never says that the disability is nil. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I have not had experience of such a decision in the last four or five years, but in the early days of the commission, after the appointment of the entitlement tribunal, I knew of many cases in which the commission had been appealed to and had refused entitlement. When the entitlement tribunal granted entitlement, the matter went back to the commission which had already refused the application. After that, the applicant has the right to appeal to the assessment tribunal, which is presided over by a legal man and two doctors. I agree with the honorable member for Reid that, if an application has been placed before a State board, and the applicant has then appealed to the entitlement tribunal and has been granted entitlement, the assessment of the pension ought to go automatically to the assessment tribunal, without having to be referred to the commission. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  This is really a matter of quick administration, rather than one requiring an amendment of the section. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- Yes. I hope the Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt)**  will consider the matter. 

Mr.Francis.  -  Sending an application back to the assessment tribunal, after entitlement has been established, would not help the soldier. There is only one assessment tribunal, and it moves from State to State. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- The itinerary of the tribunal has nothing to do with the matter. Take the case of a returned soldier in Western Australia who was getting 50 per cent. of the full pension, until one day a Repatriation Department doctor suddenly stopped his pension. He then had to appeal, and he had to wait for months before his appeal was heard by the entitlement tribunal, which again granted him entitlement. He had been drawing pension from the end of the last war to about the year 1931. During all those years he had received 50 per cent. of the full pension, but when the payment suddenly ceased, nearly six months was occupied in getting a hearing by the entitlements tribunal. The fact that the assessment tribunal had assessed the disability at 50 per cent. total incapacity showed that the pensions should have been continued,but owing to the operation of the act, he was deprived of the pension for about six months. This is a matter of administration, and, if the Minister for Repatriation will look into it, I shall be satisfied.

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">New England</small>

-- I direct the attention of the committee to section 36 of the principal act, which reads - 

  >In the case of any person who, at the time of the occurrence of the event resulting in the death or incapacity of a member of the forces (including a member of the forces within the meaning of section forty-five  at  of this act), was recognized as the wife of that member though not legally married to him, if the commission is satisfied that that person was wholly or partly dependent upon the earnings of the member, a pension under this division at a rate not exceeding the rate of pension which may be allowed under this division to the wife or widow of any such member of the forces may be allowed to- that person. 

I have received a letter with regard to a  *de facto*  widow who has been awarded the full pension at the expense of the legal widow. The commission states - 

  >The position of this case is that at the time the claim was submitted the Repatriation Commission had to consider also a claim by the  *dc facto*  widow for pension benefits for herself and adopted child and two ex-nuptial children of the late soldier residing in Victoria. 
  >
  >The commission, in its deliberations, took into account the following: - 
  >
  >the duration of the associations on a marital basis of the soldier and his  *de facto*  wife, i.e., from about 103(i; 
  >
  >the issue of that association.; 
  >
  >the soldier made a. military allotment to his  *de facto*  wife;  *{d)*  the Department of the Army recognized her to the extent of granting maximum dependant's allowance; 
  >
  >the soldier made a will and appointed his  *de facto*  wife executrix and sole beneficiary, conditionally that she cared for the three children abovementioned. 
  >
  >In view of the foregoing, and having regard to the whole of the evidence adduced in respect of each claimant and the limitations imposed by section 30 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, the commission decided no reasonable ground existed for a grant in favour of the lawful widow. 
  >
  >The net. as no doubt you are fully aware. does not permit of payment of pensions to be made to a lawful widow and  *de facto*  widow at the same time. 

The recommendation of the special parliamentary  committe  was - 

  >CJ lider the Repatriation Act of ]!)20 the commission could pay a pension to a legal wife and a  *de facto*  wife in respect of the same member. In 1!)40 the act was amended to provide that in respect of members of the 1939 war, the pension could be paid to either the legal wife or the  *de facto*  wife, but not to both. 

There is a difference between the two wars - 

  >As a result of the amendment the commission now has to determine to which woman the pension will be paid, and as far as possible an attempt is made to follow the wishes of the soldier. 

The Widows' Pensions Act contains the following definition : -  "widow" includes a  *de facto*  widow. 

It is quite permissible for the Commissioner of Pensions to pay a full widow's pension to both the legal widow and the  *de facto*  widow. After the last war the legislature provided that both the legal widow and the  *de facto*  widow should receive a full pension. To-day the legal widow or the  *de facto*  widow receives the pension according to the expressed wishes of the deceased soldier. The special committee has recommended that the pension be split between the two. I know that this is a most tricky subject. The special committee apparently had a good deal of difficulty in dealing with it. I suggest that the AttorneyGeneral look into  the matter, because there is a likelihood of legal' wives suffering grave injustice as theresult of a soldier becoming infatuated with another woman. He may take her as his  *de facto*  wife, and on his death will his pension to her and nothing tolas' legal wife, who for years may have rendered the best possible service to him. I do not propose to move an amendment,, but I think that the Government maywell consider the desirability of protecting the interests of legal widowsby ensuring that they shall be at least no less entitled than  *de facto*  widows to the pension payable to thewidows of members of the forces. 

##### Mr POLLARD:<br><small class="text-muted">Ballarat</small>

.. - It is true that I was a signatory to therecommendation made -by the special parliamentary committee regarding  *defacto*  widows. The committee's recommendation was that the pension should!  be divided equally between the legal widow and the  *de facto*  widow. There are many moralists in the community, members of churches and other well intentioned people, who take strong exception to the women who fall into the category of  *de facto*  wives, but the fact remains that the principle of recognizing  *de facto*  wives was established more than twenty years ago. In the last twenty years the opinions of the community have greatly changed. I do not imply that moral principles have weakened, but there has come to the community a greater understanding of human weaknesses. War being what it is, I think that we should consider the fact that it creates unnatural circumstances amongst soldiers. Whether we like it or not, men do take  *de facto*  wives. I think I am justified on reflection in departing from the recommendation of the special committee in this matter, and I urge that the Government should take into consideration all the circumstances and the fact that twenty years ago we established the right of  *de facto*  widows to pensions, equally with legal widows. 

##### Mr Abbott:

--  The commission should be permitted to grant the pension to both, if in its opinion it is right to do so. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- -That would put it on a satisfactory basis. 

##### Mr Calwell:

--  Provided that it does not operate to the detriment of the legal widow. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- Yes. I have to take some responsibility for the committee's recommendation. 

##### Mr Francis:

--  Our recommendation was rejected. The act remains as it stands. The honorable member's conscience is therefore clear. 

##### Mr Abbott:

--  Rut the act was changed in 1940. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- Yes, National Security Regulations were made to suspend the operation of certain sections of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. . 

##### Mr Abbott:

--  Now the pension must be paid to either one or the other, and the special committee recommended that they should share it, 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- That is definitely wrong. The recommendation of the committee is not entirely satisfactory in as much as the deserving widow, through no fault of her own, may be left out in the cold or have to share with the  *de facto*  widow. I urge the Government to give favorable consideration to pensioning both. The precedent has been established in the Widows' Pensions Act wherein the Commissioner for Pensions is empowered to grant a full pension to both the widow and the  *de facto*  widow, if he is satisfied that circumstances warrant it. Churches of all denominations and people with strong moral principles may hold that Parliament has no right to take cognizance of immorality, but the fact remains that the churches succour fallenwomen and care for their children. 

##### Mr Abbott:

--  The Pounder of the Christian Church did. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- Yes, Christ showed practical sympathy in cases such as these. It is a Christian act to remove the stigma of charity from assistance given to women whatever their marital status may be. I know that parliamentary recognition of the claims of women who without having taken the marriage vows have lived as the wives of men will invite political repercussions and that some people will allege that this or that government has encouraged immorality. Nevertheless, former governments, Labour or non-Labour have from time to time, endorsed the principle that was laid down during the last war that the claims of  *de facto*  wives and  *de facto*  widows are equal to those of wives and widows. We shall take a backward step if we do not endorse that principle again now. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">Barker &middot; ALP</small>

.; - I cannot agree with the honorable member for Ballarat (Mir. Pollard). Sooner or later we shall have to have some recognition of what the country expects in public and private morals. I considered, some time ago, when we passed, the Widows' Pensions Act that we were doing a grave disservice to the country in recognizing what are called  *de facto*  widows. I first came upon the term  *de facto*  wives when I was Minister for the Navy. I have never understood the term. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  The first use of the term  *de facto*  in- an- Act of the Commonwealth Parliament was in 1940. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- I agree with the right honorable member for Kooyong  **(Mr. Menzies)**  that the relationship sounds more respectable when it is expressed in Latin. It would be \veil to look at this relationship when expressed in plain English. A woman who is living with a man is either married or is living in adultery. 

##### Mr Abbott:

-- At present the pension may be paid to the adulteress, whilst the legal wife is neglected. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- I do not see how, for repatriation purposes, the Commonwealth can possibly recognize a man's liability to two different women. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- The Commonwealth recognized it as far back as 1918. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- That does not say that it was right. I am arguing not as to what the position is but as to what it ought to be. I submit that in this legislation the Commonwealth is embarking on procedure which is, to say the least, questionable. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- Nothing in this bill alters the present position. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- I recognize that, but I say that this is something for which the Commonwealth will be sorry before long. We are either going to recognize and protect the sanctity of married life and the right of people to bring up a legitimate family, or we are going to revert to another code of morals ' which, so far, has not been recognized in countries which still, even with reservations, call themselves Christian. If we are to get away from Christian precepts, and frankly admit that we believe in the tenets of Mohammedanism, let us do it openly and see where we shall get. The inroads which are being made by certain acts and regulations are important and serious. The Commonwealth Parliament is creating a feeling of hostility which will find definite expression before long. That resentment will be revealed in a way this Parliament will be unable to ignore. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- At present, the legal wife may be deprived of her pension by an adulteress. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- I am not arguing that point. I am declaring that this Parliament cannot recognize and subsidize a state of adultery without laying up trouble for itself. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- The honorable member would force these people to live on charity. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- Surely the man must accept some responsibility. If the Commonwealth is clearly and definitely to recognize an adulterous union that is a matter of public policy on which the electors will have something to say. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- The church recognizes these women by helping them and their children. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- Not as wives. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- I have yet to learn that that is charity. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- Nothing in this bill touches that question. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- The Attorney-General may put it that way if he likes, but there is a lot in this question which will touch the public life of this country intimately before long. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- The term "  *de facto*  wife " is both obnoxious and inaccurate, but that does not deal with the question as to whether or not she should get assistance. That is a different question. The first question is whether a woman should be called a  *de facto*  wife. I strongly object to that term, as I believe we all do. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- I object to the term " wife " being applied to this kind of woman. A woman who lives with a man is either his wife, or she is not his wife. The use of the term "  *de facto "*  does not make any real difference. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- I entirely agree. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- The Attorney-General would be well advised to deal with that error. I do not know who invented the term "  *de facto*  wife ". 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- It emanated from a member of the Government in 1940, but who he was I do not know. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- The term is wrong. I do not want this matter to be treated lightly. I do not want the committee to think that any tampering with this matter, or any pandering to a section of public opinion, will be passed by lightly. I know the feeling throughout the country on this subject. I know that if the moral looseness which is apparent to any one who walks about our city streets is not dealt with, sooner or later there will be a revulsion of feeling, and when that time comes some rather complacent people will be smitten in tender spots. I shall be pleased to see that revulsion, and I shall be interested to see how some people will react when they are smitten where I expect them to be smitten. 

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Melbourne</small>

-- If provision has not already been made I hope that it will be made to protect the interests of the legitimate wife, so that the position which has been referred to by the honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard),**  in which a legitimate wife may be deprived of her just claim upon a soldier or ex-soldier in favour of an adulteress, will not be allowed to continue. 

I wish to raise a matter affecting another class of wife, namely the wife and also the child of a service pensioner. "Under section 45ac of the existing legislation, they are entitled to consideration, provided that the child was born before the 2nd October, 1931, or that the wife was married before that date. I suggest that for the date mentioned there should be substituted the 1st day of July, 1938, in order to bring this legislation- into line with that relating to war pensions. I see no reason why the wife or child of a service pensioner should be placed at a disadvantage compared with the wife or child of a war pensioner. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- I think that this is a matter which ought to be considered, but this bill is not the place to deal with it. 

##### Mr CALWELL:

-- This is a repatriation bill. The committee which has done such excellent work in connexion with other phases of repatriation should also have reported on this phase. The subject was brought to my notice by the Victorian branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. That body has suggested that, as a matter of common justice, the definitions of " wife " and " child " for the purpose of service pensions should be brought into line with the definitions of " wife " and " child " for the purpose of war pensions. A man who is in receipt of a service pension is usually in poor circumstances, and the Victorian branch of the league believes that its request is not unreasonable. I do not know what the cost of giving effect to the suggestion would be, but I submit that cost should not be the determining factor, although I realize that sometimes our conception of justice is based on a consideration of cost. If justice can be done, it ought to be done. I urge now what I urged in my second-reading speech, namely, that where a person who is totally incapacitated marries a second time, the- second wife shall be entitled to receive a war pension. A totally incapacitated man needs the assistance of some one to care for him. A man who is bereft of his wife, and cannot look after himself, and who, moreover, has children dependent on him, may quite naturally desire that his children should have the care and attention of a step-mother. The woman whom he marries should not be disadvantaged by the fact that being married to a man who is totally incapacitated she for that reason faces the grim prospect of widowhood after, perhaps, only a few years of married life. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- A deputation waited on me in regard to this matter and I promised to look into it. 

##### Mr CALWELL:

-- I am glad to have that assurance from the Minister. There is justice in the claim. A man who is totally incapacitated is sufficiently burdened without having to worry about what would happen in the event of his helpmate passing on before him, and, may be, leaving little children for whom he can do but little. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Batman</small>

-- There is no reference in the hill to the person described by the obnoxious term  *de facto*  wife, although Such a person is referred to in the report of the committee. It seems possible that, in certain circumstances, the clause may be construed to refer to persons living with and dependent upon a member of the forces. I believe that whatever gratuity, assistance or charitable indulgence, the committee might desire to extend to a woman in that situation in which she is described as a  *de facto*  wife, it will not do itself the injustice of  reducing the status of a married woman by repeating, if it can be avoided, the use of that expression. 

I accuse myself of having suffered that expression to re-appear in recent legislation. Probably, if a woman were a member of this Parliament, sensitive to the honor of her sex, that would never have occurred. I hope that we shall take an early opportunity to remove that offensive phrase from the statute-book wherever it occurs. "We cannot afford as a Parliament, or as a country, to write down the status of married women, or the status of the family. In fact, the preservation of family life and the maintenance of the status of married women are among the objectives for which the grim struggle in which we are now engaged is being fought. I associate myself with those who reprobate this tendency to regard the marriage tie lightly. We can easily afford to be indulgent and even generous to women in an unfortunate position without that. With that observation I leave the matter, feeling that I have spoken,  **Mr. Chairman,**  by your indulgence and the indulgence of the Minister also, inasmuch as this clause does not appear to relate specifically to a person in that situation; but it is time that the Parliament made a beginning to delete this objectionable designation and in doing justice to these persons, used more discreet and appropriate language than it has used in the past. 


 **Mr.** BLACKBURN  (Bourke)  [1.50  a.m.  j. -  The phrase  *de facto*  wife does not appear in this statute at all. It appears in a marginal note to section  36  of the principal act, and there is no definition of it in the act. Two questions arise on this point, and they must be kept apart. The first is the propriety of the use of the phrase; and the second is the propriety of making a payment to a woman whose relation to the soldier has been that of what we call a  *de facto*  wife. 

##### Mr Marwick:

-- -  In other words an adulteress. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- I shall not use that word ; I do not like it. Canada has made a provision very much similar to the provision we have made. I. take it that the honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron)**  does not quarrel with the provision being made for this class of woman, but with the description of her as a  *de facto*  wife. I have in my hand a reprint of the Canadian Pension 

Act  1919-1936.  Canada has made a provision for the woman who, though not being married to a soldier, was either recognized by him as his wife, or ought fairly to have been recognized by 'him as his wife. In the case of the death of the soldier the Canadian legislation has provided since  1919 - 

{: type="1" start="32"}
0. -- (3) A woman who, although not married to the member of the forces, was living with hi'm in Canada at the time he became a member of the forces and for a reasonable time previously thereto, and who, at such time, was publicly represented by him as his wife may, in the case of his death and in the discretion of the Commission, bc awarded a  pension  equivalent to the pension she would have received had she been his legal widow, and the Commission may also award a pension if, in its opinion, an injustice would be done by not recognizing a woman as the wife of a member of the forces although there is no evidence that she had been publicly represented by him . as his wife: Provided that such woman shall not be refused a pension for which she would have been eligible under the provisions hereof if she had remained unmarried, by reason only of her having married the member of the forces with whom she had been living as aforesaid. 

The last proviso refers to the case of a woman who marries a soldier after the war. In the case of a disabled soldier, the Canadian act provides - 

{: type="1" start="3"}
0. -- (5) If a member of the forces, in respect of a disability pension, was, before the 1st day of May, 1933, living with a woman to whom ho was not legally married and since that date such woman has continuously been maintained by him and represented by him as his wife, the commission may, in its discretion, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (&amp;) of section thirty of the amending act of 1930, if the said member of the forces has married or hereafter marries the said woman, award additional pension for a married member of the forces from the date of marriage or from the 1st day of August, 1930, whichever is the later date. 

That means that a woman who had that relationship towards a disabled soldier would not receive anything unless he married her. The Canadian act also provides that a pension may be refused to the wife of a married soldier if she does not live with him and is not maintained by him. The 'Canadian position is interesting because the Canadian view on these matters is much stricter than ours. In Quebec divorce cannot be obtained except by act of parliament, and, until recently, it was general in Canada that no one could obtain a  divorce by judicial proceedings. In Canada there is a strong opposition to divorce, supported generally, and particularly in Quebec, by the Catholic church; yet Canada has dealt with this matter on almost the same lines as we have dealt with it in Australia. I quite agree with those who object to the use of the phrase  *de facto*  wife in our statutes. It is objectionable; but that should not prevent us from doing justice to the woman with whom the soldier has had that relationship. If we are not going to insist that every soldier must be a sexual rigorist we must provide for the woman with whom he has had that relationship.

Clause 31- 

  >Section forty-fiveas of Principal Act is amended - 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- I move - 

  >That, after paragraph (a), the following paragraph be inserted: - " (ab) by omitting the word 'seven' (first and second occurring) and inserting in its stead the word 'fifteen'; and ". 

This amendment is in pursuance of the Government's decision to extend the time limit with respect to the eligibility for pensions of the soldier's wife and children from seven to fifteen years. It means that any woman who married a member of the present forces prior to fifteen years after discharge of the member will be entitled to receive a war pension in respect of any incapacity suffered by the member due to war service, or to receive a pension in respect of her husband's death from war service. Any children born of such a marriage will be pensionable, notwithstanding the date of birth. The provision applies also to eligibility for service pensions. 

Amendment agreed to.

##### Mr RYAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Flinders</small>

.- I direct the attention of the Government to the restrictive conditions of the proviso of sub-section 1 of section 45au of the principal act. At present, the Commonwealth Government is liable to pay to the member, or his dependants, or both, as the case may be, pensions in accordance with division 1, provided that - 

{: type="i" start="i"}
0. is not duo to the default or wilful act of the member; 
1. does not arise from intentionally self-inflicted injuries; and 
2. iii ) does not arise from, or from any occurrence happening during the commission of any breach of discipline by the member; 

When those conditions apply, the member and his dependants are not eligible to participate in the benefits under the act. This provision causes severe hardship. To clarify my point, I cite a case that occurred recently in my electorate. A soldier, the father of three children, was summoned to his home owing to the illness of his wife. He was granted a certain period of leave,but he overstayed it, because her condition was serious. When he reported to his unit, he was sentenced to a period of detention for having been absent without leave. When his wife's condition became worse, he broke out of the detention section and was shot dead by a guard.  His  wife appealed for compensation or a pension under the act, but this could not be granted because of the operation of paragraph (iii) of the proviso. As the result of the husband's breach of discipline, his wife and three children are left destitute. I suggest that the proviso should be amended by leaving out paragraph (i) and by making paragraph (iii) more specific by stipulating a " serious breach of discipline ". That would permit the Repatriation Commission to decide whether the breach of discipline was sufficiently serious as to warrant the exclusion of a man's dependants from the benefits of the act. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- The departmental view is that the word " default " must be retained in (i) in order to prevent the payment of a pension to a sufferer from venereal disease. However, I recognize the merit of the honorable member's contention, and shall give careful consideration to the matter. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- Perhaps the requisite amendment can be made in the Senate? 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- Yes.

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- I direct the attention of the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  to the position of members of the Women's Land Army who have been recruited for service and I desire to know whether consideration has been given to the claims of personnel, compared with the claims of the members of the Voluntary Aid Detachment. It can hardly be said that members of the Women's Land Army are entitled to repatriation benefits, but some of them will possibly be engaged in or near operational areas and military establishments. If the matter has not yet been considered, I ask the Minister to investigate the position later. I am prepared to accept a ministerial assurance to that effect. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  The matter will receive consideration.. 

##### Mr BARNARD:<br><small class="text-muted">BASS, TASMANIA &middot; ALP</small>

.Will the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  briefly explain the purpose of these amendments ? 

##### Mr Frost:

--  They are verbal and consequential amendments and relate to the women's forces. 

Clause, as amended, agreed to. 

Clause 37- 

  >Section 47 of the Principal Act is 'repealed. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

-- I move - 

  >That after the word " repealed " the following be inserted: - "and the following section inserted in its stead: - 
  >
  >Where a member of the Forces is in receipt of a pension at the general rate for total incapacity under the first schedule to this act or .at the special rate of pension under the second schedule to this act, the Commonwealth shall, subject to the regulations, be liable to provide free medical treatment and, where so ordered by a medical practitioner, free hospital treatment for the member during such periods as it is necessary for him to undergo such treatment.' ". 

This is a proposal to provide free hospital treatment for all those persons who are totally and permanently or even temporarily incapacitated, including blinded soldiers and those suffering from tuberculosis. All these people are on full pensions, their health is constantly at a low ebb and so is their resistance, and they are subject, because of their weak physical condition, to all epidemic contagious and infectious diseases. It is essential therefore that they should be granted free hospital treatment for any sickness. They are required to subsist entirely on their pension, and it is unreasonable that the pension should be used by them to pay for hospital treatment for any disease or malady from which they suffer as a direct consequence of their  Avar  service. If they had not gone to the war and been so seriously affected that they are entitled to a full pension, they would not suffer from so many diseases as they do to-day. I understand that the Minister is favorably disposed towards the amendment, and is prepared to accept it. If it is made law it will do a great deal to bring financial relief to these people and at the same time help to improve their health.- 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- I refer the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  to the statement made by me in the House on the 9th March, in which I indicated that the Government would introduce a regulation to allow free medical or hospital treatment under certain conditions for all disabilities suffered by members of the forces who are in receipt of war pensions at the general rate for total incapacity under the first schedule of the act or at the special rate under the second schedule. This of course will include those members who are blinded, temporarily or permanently totally incapacitated, or suffering from tuberculosis. In view of the Government's decision in this matter I ask that the honorable member withdraw the amendment. Full power already exists in the act to provide this treatment by the introduction of a regulation. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

-- I accept the Minister's assurance that all that is being sought by my amendment will be provided by regulation. 

Amendment -  *by leave*  - withdrawn. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

. I move - 

  >That after the word " repealed " the following be inserted: - "and the following section inserted in its stead: - 47a.  Where  a member of the Forces is suffering from tuberculosis and has, for  a  period of three years or more, been in receipt of a pension at a rate of not less than the maximum special rate of pension specified at any time during that period in the second schedule to this act, the children of the member shall, during any period during which the member continues to receive a pension at that rate, be entitled to participate in any soldiers' children education scheme prepared under the regulations as if they were eligible children for the purposes of that scheme.' ". 

For a long time the trustees of the McCaughey Bequest, administering the legacy of about £500,000 left by the late  **Sir Samuel**  McCaughey, pastoralist, for the benefit of children of deceased or incapacitated soldiers, have been providing money for the education and training of children of deceased, totally and permanently incapacitated, or blinded soldiers. A large number of such soldiers are on full pensions, but these are in fact regarded as temporary pensions as the recipients are required to come up for medical review every six or twelve months. As the fund was being reduced, the children of tubercular soldiers, who are receiving full pensions on what are known as temporary rates, have been denied the bursary benefits which the trust offers. It is estimated that the legacy will yield over £750,000, and up to date about £620,000 has been spent. No similar assistance is yet available for the children of members of this war. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment, because the rate of pension is not affected. If this is a case which he thinks can be better dealt with by regulation, I am prepared to meet him as I did in regard to the previous amendment. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- I intimated in the statement made by me in the House on the 9th March last that certain benefits may be provided by way of regulation. Benefits under the soldiers' children education scheme are provided for under the regulations framed under the act, and the Government' has decided to approve the extension of the scheme to the children of members of the forces who have been receiving the special rate pension of £8 a fortnight under the second schedule in respect of tuberculosis, for a period of three years or more. This will come into operation as soon as the appropriate regulation has been promulgated. It is considered that the provision now suggested should not be embodied in the act, as it can be adequately provided for by regulation. I therefore ask that the amendment be withdrawn. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

-- I am pleased to accept the Minister's assurance that what I ask for in my amendment will he done by regulation and to accede to his request. 

Amendment -  *by leave*  - wiithdrawn 

##### Mr SPOONER:<br><small class="text-muted">Robertson</small>

-- I do not wish to disturb what appears to be a very satisfactory arrangement, but I should like the Minister to explain why the Government prefers to deal with this matter by regulation rather than by an amendment of the act as proposed by the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis).**  "We all know the general objection that exists to the growing tendency to legislate by regulation. 

Wherever it is possible for these matters to be dealt with in legislation, it is preferable to do so. People who read the Repatriation Act in order to ascertain their rights may more easily understand the position if they can find everything within the act itself than if they have to watch for regulations which they may not be able to obtain. The Minister may be able to tell the committee that this class of benefit is already dealt with comprehensively under regulations, and if that is the case I am satisfied. If not, I suggest that the honorable member for Moreton should press his amendment. Generally speaking, the tendency to deal by regulation with matters which should be dealt with by legislation is far too extensive, and should be curbed by Parliament as soon as possible. 


 **Mr. FROST** (Franklin- Minister for Repatriation [2.28 a.m.]. - This matter is dealt with principally by regulation. The whole of the trust referred to is already covered in that way, and we prefer to continue that practice. All that is required is an amendment of an existing regulation. I am sure that the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  will be satisfied. 

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Melbourne</small>

-- Section 47 of the principal act, which clause 37 proposes to repeal, is the section which gives the commission power to make  recommendations as to regulations. If it is repealed, will that mean that the commission can no longer make recommendations to the GovernorGeneral in the matter of regulations? If so, who is going to make such recommendations? Will the Government take action on its own initiative, or where is the power of recommendation left in the act or the bill to enable regulations to be gazetted in the future? 

##### Mr Spender:

--  Provision is made in section 60 of the act. 

##### Mr Francis:

--  Also in clause 40 of the bill. 

##### Mr CALWELL:

-- I should like the Minister to explain briefly why it is intended to deprive the commission of the power which it has enjoyed to make recommendations in regard to regulations. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  The departmental officials have supplied the explanation that section 47 has been found unnecessary because all action concerning the making of regulations can be taken under section 60. 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wentworth</small>

-- I move - 

  >That after the word " repealed " the following words be inserted : - " and the following section inserted in its stead: -  47b. The regulations shall make provision for the granting of preference in employment to members of the Forces.' ". 

##### Mr Blackburn:

--  I rise to a point  of  order. The honorable member has moved for the insertion of a new section which has no relation to section 47. Several honorable members have given notice  of  their intention to move for the insertion of new clauses in priority to the provision which he proposes to insert. I am one of those, and I consider that I should not be deprived by this device of my prior right to move an amendment. 

##### Mr Harrison:

--  Clause 37 proposes that section 47 shall be repealed. I am moving to give to the Minister the power to make a certain regulation. I take it that that falls properly within section 47. It is really an addendum to clause 37. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  I appreciate the point that has been raised by the honorable member for Bourke; but it surely relates to the position that would exist if the proposal were to insert a new clause which was not in substitution of the section that was to be either repealed or amended. 

##### Mr Blackburn:

--  Section 47 deals with recommendations, not regulations. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  That is true; hut the amendment would appear to be sufficiently germane to warrant its insertion. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The Chair is  of  the opinion that it is competent for the honorable member to move the amendment at this point. 

##### Mr HARRISON:

-- I regard as an integral part of any repatriation legislation, the provision that preference in employment shall be given to members  of  the services about to be repatriated.  I  cannot imagine any repatriation legislation being enacted by any country which would not contain some such provision. I fail to see how it will be possible  to  restore these men to employment, and enable them again to take up work in industry which their war service has caused them to drop, unless the country  in whose service they have fought gives to them a measure of preference. This will give to returned men' the right to earn their livelihood, which they would find it very hard to earn if not given some help by a generous and grateful country. They ask for no more than that they shall be given the right to earn a livelihood, and should be given no less by a grateful country. 

Let us examine some of the reasons in support of preference in employment being given to the returned soldier. He has been taken out of industry, and placed in the service of his country. The man who has been at the bench loses his aptitude and efficiency in the years during which he is absent from it. This has been made obvious by no less a person than Lieutenant-Colonel Madgwick, Director of Education and Vocational Training in the Department of the Army. Giving evidence before the special committee, he said - 

  >We have taken nien out of their normal civil employments and have changed them fundamentally. We have removed the motive that would actuate them in their civil life. We have taken from them, all striving to gain a livelihood. Shortly, we have changed them; they are different social beings. In the course of that process of change, we have put them into an environment in which they cannot get a full appreciation of the changes that are occurring in the economic and social structure. 

He placed his finger exactly on the core of the matter, in drawing attention to the fact that these men have been taken out of their avocations and placed in an entirely different atmosphere under completely different circumstances. They will return to civil life strange to the new economic set of conditions that have grown up, and will have lost the efficiency which was theirs prior to having been, called up.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Madgwick went on to say - 

  >Those men who aTO skilled tradesmen or process workers have two major advantages over the men in the Army. In the first place, they are maintaining and increasing their skill; and in the second place, they arc working in a changing economy, and are understanding the changes by reason of their participation in them. The man in the Army is losing his skill and is not being given the training that is being given to the ordinary civilian population. Therefore, when he returns to civil life he will have lost a good deal of the skill that he formerly possessed and will certainly Hot have been trained for all of those new trades that developed during the war. 

That is a very clear exposition of the state in which the returned soldier will find himself when he is on the verge of being repatriated. No repatriation act could be complete, just or proper unless it gave preference in employment to these men, in order that they may be rehabilitated in the industrial economy of the nation. 

There is also another section of men who will need looking after - the younger men who have not established themselves in a trade or profession. Some of them may have served a portion of their apprenticeship, whilst others may have matriculated and completed one year in a faculty at a university. The whole of their outlook may have been altered by their service. How often was it found after . the last war that a young man who had trained himself for a profession could not re-enter it upon his return? The outdoor life and the upsetting conditions had caused him to reorientate the whole of his outlook in regard to his employment. Some men found their way on to the land, whilst others took up an industrial occupation. Unless preference is given, these men will not be able to find their way back into industry. The country must nurse them back into employment, and give them the opportunity to re-establish themselves in industry. I know that this proposal cuts across the principles of the Government. It's concern is with preference to unionists, and the establishment of compulsory unionism. The Government of New South Wales, which is of the same party-political colour a3 the (Commonwealth Administration, proposes to enact legislation along those lines. Even with the country at war, this Government is enforcing the principle of preference to unionists. The Government believes in preference in employment to industrial workers, so surely it cannot deny as favorable treatment to members of the fighting services. If the Government believes that industrial workers, who are employed under favorable conditions, should be given preference, it cannot in fairness offer less to members of the fighting forces who are risking disablement or death under the  most appalling conditions. I do not want to flog the issue, because it is undesirable at this time to .rouse party feelings. If this benefit is not conferred upon the soldiers, although they may win the war f or us, they may well lose the peace. There are 700,000 men in the forces, and after the war they will demand their rights. It will go hard with any government that denies them preference in the matter of employment. 

##### Dr EVATT:<br><small class="text-muted">AttorneyGeneral &middot; Barton &middot; ALP</small>

-- The committee would render a disservice to the returned soldiers if it accepted this amendment. The policy of the Government in regard to preference to returned soldiers has been announced by the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  and is favorable to the general principle of preference. In answer to a question asked in the Senate, on the 27th  *3*  January last, the Prime Minister, as reported on page 12 of  *Hansard,*  said that the Government .believed that preference, although necessary, was far from adequate, and that what should be done was to obtain security of employment for servicemen. Returned soldier organizations are now insisting, not on preference in the narrow sense, but on the guarantee of employment. This hill is not the measure in which we should embody preference proposals. To deal with the matter in the crude way suggested would be unworthy of the Parliament and of the returned servicemen themselves. The amendment provides that regulations shall make provision for the granting of preference in employment to members of the forces. Does the honorable member mean all members of the forces whether they have been on active, combatant service or not, and whether they have been abroad or not? 

##### Mr Harrison:

--  All of them will have lost their skill, or the opportunity to acquire skill. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- The Government is now drafting legislation to deal with this matter, and I beg the committee not to prejudice the principle of guaranteeing employment to returned soldiers by accepting the amendment. The honorable member asks for preference in employment, but at what point - at the point of engagement, during employment, or at the termination of employment? The honorable member made what was for him a favorable reference to unionists; does he wish returned soldiers to be placed in the same category as unionists? 

##### Mr Harrison:

--  I do not believe in preference to unionists. I said that the Government had declared itself in favour of preference to unionists, and therefore could not deny preference to returned soldiers. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- The important thing is what the Government policy is. The Repatriation Act, which was passed at the end of ;the last war, contained no provision for preference to returned soldiers. The matter was then regarded as one for State Parliaments to deal with. 

I believe in substantial preference to returned soldiers, but I ask those who think in the same way not to prejudice the application of this principle by insisting that regulations be issued under this bill to provide for preference. 

##### Mr Calwell:

--  The matter should be dealt with by legislation. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- I agree. It would be most unsatisfactory to attempt to deal with it by regulations under the Repatriation Act. As I have already said, legislation is now being prepared. 

##### Mr Coles:

--  "Will the Government give an undertaking that legislation will be introduced ? 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- Fes, and I am convinced that legislation will emerge which will be of great benefit to returned soldiers. 

##### Mr Blackburn:

--  When will it be done? 

##### Mr Curtin:

--  We cannot complete a draft of the bill until we know what powers are to be transferred to the Commonwealth by the States. 

##### Mr Harrison:

--  So it is another " Kathleen Mavourneen " scheme. 

##### Mr Curtin:

--  It is not. It is obvious that the powers of this Parliament will be conditioned by the authority given to it to deal with employment and unemployment. To the degree that Parliament will have power to deal with those ma'tters, the Government will frame legislation for presentation to Parliament. 

##### Dr EVATT:

-- I ask the committee not to prejudice the broader policy of preference by accepting the amendment, but to get on with the . bill. 

##### Mr BARNARD:<br><small class="text-muted">Bass</small>

.I ask you,  **Mr. Chairman,**  whether I am at liberty to discuss the clause as a whole, or whether I must confine myself to the amendment? 

The  **CHAIRMAN (Mr. Prowse).The**  honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison)**  has moved an amendment to the clause, and the honorable member must confine himself to the amendment. 

##### Mr BARNARD:

-- I listened with mixed feelings to the speech of the honorable member for Wentworth, who moved an amendment, the purpose of which is to give preference to returned soldiers. So far as I am concerned, the important factor is what is meant by preference to returned soldiers. Does it include nurses and other women in the services as well as men? When the Government proceeds to deal with the broad question of preference to returned soldiers, it should provide a measure of social justice, not only for the soldiers who have fought on the battlefields, but also those for whom the soldiers have fought. I agree that the lives of the soldiers have been disturbed, that, on their ultimate return to civil life, employment must be found for them, and that they must receive the protection of the Parliament and the country; but the claims of the men and women in industry who have been producing the munitions of war must also be considered. In many instances, industrial workers have been prevented from taking their place in the field, and that alters the whole principle of preference as we knew it after the last war. How can we say that the man who has been in uniform must be given preference over those who have been retained in industry because of their special skill and ability? There should be a balanced preference. The matter is one in which I take a lively interest, and I regard it from the broad aspect of the social security of the people. I desire to see a balanced economy after the war. I agree with what has been said by the Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt)**  and by interjection, by the Prime Minister  **(Mr.** 

Curtin), who pointed out that the matter should not be dealt with in a haphazard way by accepting the proposed amendment to the clause under consideration. The Prime Minister has indicated that 

Separate  legislation is needed, in order to make proper provision both for returned soldiers and for the other people to whom the right honorable gentleman has referred. The returned soldier has a right to the protection of this Parliament in the new social order which we expect after the war. 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Wakefield</small>

-- Among the less satisfactory features of this bill is the fact that no provision is made with regard to either land settlement or preference to returned soldiers. On the subject of land settlement, the special committee recommended that expert authorities be appointed to deal with it, and the Government has said that it will be. dealt with by a rural settlement committee. How can we settle people on the land unless they have a reasonable chance of making a success of their holdings? 

Despite what the Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt)**  has said, I consider thai the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison)**  can be properly accepted as part of a repatriation measure. The special committee recommended that, wherever practicable, preference must be given to members of the forces in the matter of employment. Some criticism has been heard regarding the bluntness of the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth,  but  the recommendation of the special committee is blunt enough. The decision of the Government regarding the matter was that the views of the special committee should be referred to an interdepartmental committee. It is stated that the report of the latter committee  ha3  been received and has been considered by the Government, but certain details remain to be finalized. The least that honorable members are entitled to be told by the Government is the nature of the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee. The report of the special committee is dated the 3rd February last, and not a word has been said by the Attorney:General as to what  is contained in the report of the interdepartmental committee. Members have had no word of what has been said on the matter of preference to returned soldiers in that report. The matter has lapsed and we know nothing about it. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- It has not lapsed. 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:

-- All that we have had up to the present is a statement that the matter will be dealt with later, when the increased powers to be granted to the Commonwealth shall have been determined. Honorable members should be supplied with the recommendations in detail of the inter-departmental committee, to enable them to decide whether they are sufficient to justify them in allowing the matter to stand in abeyance for the . present. As the special committee has made a recommendation on the matter which clearly comes within the ambit of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, we are entitled for the time being to safeguard the position by acceptance of the amendment. I have no objection to the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth. As I read his amendment, it does not lay down an absolute and complete preference to every body, but it confines the preference to members of the forces. It states that regulations shall be made dealing with this matter and it implies essentially preference to soldiers. It seems to me that the words "to a member of the forces " would include a member of the Citizen Military Forces, and it would therefore be advisable to add the words "who have been on active service under the terms of the act ". That would imply active service, especially service overseas. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- That shows that the amendment is not sufficiently clear. If the regulations were made in that form, they could not be departed from. 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:

-- Under the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth it would be possible to promulgate regulations substantially for preference in employment to members of the forces, and that would include the Militia. I personally prefer that the preference should be limited to the members of the fighting forces who have been in a zone of operations. The amendment, which is in general terms, should be clarified by regulations, but that is better than no provision at all, because it would at least admit the principle. I can foresee many difficulties. There may be a choice as between the Militia and the auxiliary services on the one hand and rejected or -wounded volunteers on the other. That is why the amendment should be couched in general terms. 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP; LP from 1944</small>

-- It does not apply to women. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- Women could not have preference under this amendment. 

##### Mr Harrison:

-- The Government could widen the provision, if it desired to do so. 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:

-- Until that point has been settled elsewhere, I shall support the amendment. 

##### Mr POLLARD:<br><small class="text-muted">Ballarat</small>

-- The special committee, realizing that, although the matter of preference was somewhat outside its terms of reference, gave consideration to the subject in an atmosphere entirely devoid of politics, notwithstanding that all shades of political opinion were represented. None of us had any desire to make political capital. After examining all the factors of this most difficult problem the most that the committee was prepared to say was to say that' - 

  >The evidence quoted in paragraph 22 directs attention to the necessity for all reasonable measures in the favour of members whereby the handicaps to which they are subjected by service can be off-set. The committee recommends that it be public policy that wherever practicable preference must be given to members of the forces in the matter of employment. 

Note the words " wherever practicable ". The position of the country in this war is very much different from its position in the last war when the majority of our forces actually saw active service. Further, in the last war, no man of military age was prevented " from leaving his employment to enlist, whereas this Parliament has prevented thousands of young men from throwing up their positions to carry out their ardent desire to enlist in the forces. In addition, the special committee was not unmindful of the fact that preference to returned soldiers has never satisfactorily operated, notwithstanding legislation and pious hopes. Preference to returned soldiers has been kicked around like a football by party politicians. The amendment of the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison)**  will not achieve one scrap of preference for any returned soldier inasmuch as it does not empower either this Parliament, or the Repatriation Commission, to compel private employers of labour to give preference to 'returned soldiers when seeking the services of men out of whose labour they will profit. People employ other people only to make a profit of some sort out of their service. If I, assuming I was not a returned soldier, and the honorable member for Bendigo  **(Mr. Rankin),**  a soldier in. the 1914-18 war, were competing for a job, I should get it, because I am more active and younger and would be more likely to do more work. 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- The honorable member flatters himself. I should at least try to work, but he would rest in the shade. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- That is how preference to returned soldiers has operated since the last war. This amendment would not change the position in the least. The honorable member for Wentworth knows that it would not even change the position in respect of government employment. The political party to which the honorable member belongs, notwithstanding the preachings of some of its members - I am glad to say not all - has never applied the policy of preference to returned soldiers. The party contains some fine, capable returned, soldier members, but, as the successor to the late  **Mr. J.**  A. Lyons, as Prime Minister, the party chose not an ex-serviceman, but the man whom they thought would do the best job for the party - the right honorable member for Kooyong  **(Mr. Menzies).** 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- What did the Labour party do in the Senate? 

##### Mr Curtin:

-- Exactly the same thing. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- Yes, but we have never indulged in the humbug, cant and hypocrisy about preference of the sort indulged in this morning by the honorable member for Wentworth and those who have supported him. When the House of Representatives met to elect its  Speaker  the United Australia party ignored the honorable member for Bendigo, a returned soldier, who would have filled the Speaker's chair with great dignity, and bestowed the Speakership on the honorable member for Perth  **(Mr. Nairn),**  who was not a returned soldier. Similarly, you,  **Mr. Chairman,**  a nonreturned soldier, were chosen to act with grace and dignity as  Chairman  of Committees. The honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  had no qualms about opposing a returned soldier in his constituency. Honorable members opposite do not practise what they preach. For 25 years, preference to returned soldiers has been the policy of this country, but of what value has it been to ex-service men. The great industrial concerns and banking houses have not taken the slightest notice of it. One day in Ballarat I met, in uniform, a returned soldier whom I know, and said, " Good day, Jack, how are you ? " and he said, " Good oh - never better off in my life ! I was on the dole for eighteen months and now I am in the Volunteer Defence Corps and I pet six " bob " a day and two " bob " deferred pay and 3s. 6d. a day for the wife and some more for the children. Peace on the home front at last ! " That is how preference has worked for that man and for thousands like him under the rule of anti-Labour governments. I am satisfied that if this Government remains in power it will make it unnecessary to mention preference because we shall provide jobs for all instead of the 5s. 9d. a week which governments composed of men of the same calibre as honorable gentlemen opposite doled out to them instead of work. My policy is that stated in the report of the special committee which has been endorsed by the honorable member for Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald),**  the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  and  **Senator Collett,**  who were members of the committee with myself as  chairman.  I remember that I was opposed at the last general elections by a civilian. I am certain that the honorable member for Wentworth did not send a telegram to him saying, " Stand clown for Reggie Pollard ; he is a digger ". Oh, no! That would not have suited the honorable member and his friends. For goodness' sake let us be practical and sensible. 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- I thought that the honorable member -was chasing the cheers of munitions workers. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- The honorable member for Bendigo knows as well as I do that thousands of the munitions workers served in the last war and that thousands of other munitions workers are the sons and daughters and wives of exservice men. Why the honorable member should be obsessed about munitions workers I do not know. I warrant that the honorable member has loafed in a shady patch in his paddocks away from the heat of the sun. I have seen the honorable member sound asleep in this chamber when important measures were being discussed. It is high time that this traducing of munitions workers ceased. I accept the undertaking given by the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  and the Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt).**  I consider the amendment futile. 

##### Mr MCDONALD:<br><small class="text-muted">Corangamite</small>

-- Not many honorable members have been asleep while the honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard)**  has been speaking. The honorable gentleman was correct when he stated that a unanimous decision was- arrived at by the special committee which considered repatriation matters. That committee affirmed the principle of preference to returned soldiers. I disagree, however, with other statements made by the honorable member because I believe that if it was competent and wise for the special committee to affirm the principle exactly the same rule should apply to this Parliament. I believe that the time to affirm that principle is now. One member of the Opposition has suggested that men engaged in this country who are not allowed to leave their present jobs should be placed on an equal footing with the men on active service. A man who lives in comparative comfort and security and enjoys good wages has an opportunity to provide for himself and his family which is denied to the man who goes on active service. I believe also that the man who goes on active service loses several of the best years of his life in which he may qualify for a trade or profession. It is not only necessary, but it is also ordinary justice, to ensure that that man will have preference on his return home. I do not believe that the people of Australia will stand for any man being told in effect, "Look, old man, we want you to fight for this country. Its safety depends on you; but when you -come back you will have to battle to get a job ". Recently the Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt)**  has had a good deal to say about that fair deal which he intends to give to returned soldiers. The honorable gentleman has gone out of his way to say how badly returned soldiers were treated after the last war. I repeat what I- have said formerly that I do not subscribe to that, view. The returned soldiers were not badly treated. Large sums of money were expended in the interests of returned soldiers; but what the people did hot realize was that many men were not competent to get back into civil life when they left the Army because years of rigid Army discipline had, in some degree, destroyed their initiative. They found it almost impossible to compete with men who had been here all the time. It was because of such things that there were so many complaints. It was not because the people, or governments, were unwilling to help the returned men but because in many instances they were unable to help themselves. Because of that experience of the last war, the non-party special committee arrived at a unanimous decision. I believe that it would not prejudice any future legislation for this committee to reaffirm the principle of preference to returned soldiers. It would at least show that we recognize that we owe a debt of gratitude to them which, mere money can never pay, and that we at least intend to give to them a chance to rehabilitate themselves as the people who have never been asked to go away have had an opportunity to do. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Fremantle &middot; ALP</small>

-- I have no objection whatever to the committee reaffirming its adherence to the principle of preference to returned soldiers - that is what the special committee recommended - but I have an absolute objection to giving expression to that principle by the doubtful authority of a regulation. The amendment prescribes that it shall be done by regulation. I submit that that would be a very poor realization of the purpose that the committee has in mind. 

First of all, there would be uncertainty as to the tenure of such a regulation. The present Government, like previous governments, has found this problem one of great difficulty. That the previous Government could not solve it is clear from the fact that it brought down no legislation to deal with it; nor did it issue any regulation to deal with it. The war had been going on for two years when that government went out of office, and many men had returned from the war. There were also those who had been disabled in the conflict, or were suffering the disabilities to which the honorable member for Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald)**  has properly referred. That government appointed an inter-departmental committee; but that is all that it did.- The report of that committee was not presented until the present Government came into office. Since the report was presented the Government has taken action; it has directed that legislation be prepared to deal with this matter. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- How long has the Government had the report? 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- The matter came before the War Cabinet oh the 2nd February of this year, and the War Cabinet arrived at a decision. I have the papers here. Many problems arise, one of which is that we must first have a proper legal definition of " war ". 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- I thought that every one knew what war is. 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- The matter is not so simple as that. For instance, is Darwin a place where war has occurred? I ask the committee not to jeopardize the effectiveness of the policy of preference to returned soldiers by blindly setting out to accomplish its purpose by regulation. That means leaving to the Executive the exercise of powers within the powers of the Parliament, to deal in a partial way with a problem which must be dealt with as a whole. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- Under the present proposal, a person who never left Victoria Barracks is entitled to preference. 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- I have a view in regard to this matter which relates not to the principle, but . to the application of the principle. I do not see any distinction between a merchant seaman in this present period and men who may be engaged in Victoria Barracks for the duration of the war. 

##### Mr McDonald:

-- I see a great distinction between them. The merchant seaman is far ahead of the other. 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- He is not a returned soldier within the meaning of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. 


 *Honorable members interjecting,* 


##### Mr CURTIN:

-- If the committee will not hear me, perhaps I may be allowed to say to the country that legislation is being prepared for submission to the Parliament, so that the Parliament may be able to apply its collective wisdom to the problem. The Parliament must accept the responsibility not only for the affirmation of the principle, but also for the way in which that principle shall be applied and to whom it shall be applied. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- What will become of the agreements made by the previous Government with the trade unions on the dilution of labour policy? 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- That is a matter which must be taken into account. Certain undertakings were given. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- What agreements has the right honorable gentleman in mind? 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- The Government of which the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  was a member made certain agreements with the trade unions. It is impossible to discuss the whole problem of preference to returned soldiers on the amendment moved by the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison).**  The subject covers so wide a field that the proper way to bring it before the Parliament, so that a decision can be obtained, is by the submission of a bill. I undertake to introduce a bill for that purpose. I have to say now, as I said earlier by way of interjection, that insofar as this legislation will be applicable to employers in industry, it must be recognized that the bill must have relation to the powers of the Parliament. 

##### Mr Rankin:

-- -When does the right honorable gentleman propose to introduce the bill? 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- I hope to be able to introduce it during the next term of the Parliament. A carefully prepared mea.sure is necessary. Not only should the authority of the Parliament be invoked  in regard to the affirmation of the principle, but also the Parliament must accept the responsibility for the application of the principle. That responsibility should not rest on the Executive alone. This is a problem of great difficulty. I do not wish to traverse what took place after the last war, except to say that this Government has continued a practice which has lessened the application of the principle of preference to returned soldiers in the Commonwealth Service in that university graduates have been appointed to the Public Service, even though, in the nature of things, they could not be returned soldiers. 

##### Mr Francis:

--  That applies to only 10 per cent, of the appointees. 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- Some provision of that nature must be continued in the interests of efficiency of administration in the years to come ; yet that practice represents some departure from the principle of absolute preference to returned soldiers. Many things must be taken into consideration if the principle is to work satisfactorily, having regard to all the requirements. Among those who have served this country well, are numbers of workmen who are not enlisted men. There is a Civil Constructional Corps now operating in a place beyond the mainland of Australia. Those men areengaged in an active theatre of war and have actually been bombed by the enemy. Having regard to the quality of the service that they are rendering to the nation they are as much entitled to preference as are many men in uniform who have walked daily from their homes to their offices since the war commenced. I think that that principle would be acceptable to any Parliament. Much depends on the place and the nature of the service that a man has rendered. 

##### Mr Beck:

--  Even the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia prescribes what men may, or may not, join their organization. Men must have served in certain areas to be eligible for membership. 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- As the honorable member has pointed out, organizations of returned soldiers impose certain limitations on membership. Not only will this Parliament have to deal with the matter much more deliberately than is practicable on the amendment moved by the honorable member for Wentworth, but also it will have to deal with it in a way which will ensure that every aspect will be given adequate consideration.  

##### Mr Francis:

--  Is the Government still giving preference to returned soldiers in the Public Service? 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- Yes. 

##### Mr Francis:

--  Is the same principle being honoured in connexion with contracts ? 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- The present situation is such that there is no question of preference in employment. There are no persons competing for work, because there is no unemployment. At the moment, the question of preference in the Public Service, or in connexion with government contracts, or in private industry, does not arise. People are being compelled to work. That rule applies to non-unionists, as well as to soldiers. Nonunionists are being given every encouragement to work by the present Government. I ask the honorable member for Wentworth to accept what I have said as the proper view for the committee to take. I hope to present a bill during the next sessional period. If that measure be not satisfactory the Parliament can amend it. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:<br><small class="text-muted">Dalley</small>

-- I regret that I was not in the chamber when the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  commenced his speech. However, I wish to address myself to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison).**  The Prime Minister has suggested that the whole of the responsibility of making regulations rests with the Government; but I remind him that the amendment makes it mandatory for the Government to enact regulations for the purpose set out, and does not leave anything to the discretion of the Government. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  Mandatory for the Government to do what? 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- That it shall make regulations for the granting of preference to members of the forces. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  What degree of preference? Many matters are left undefined in the amendment. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- That is so. I oppose the amendment for several reasons. It is the greatest piece of humbug which the Opposition has advanced during this  debate. If honorable members opposite think that they will receive any encouragement from the soldiers for this form of preference they are mistaken. The great majority of the men who are serving in our fighting forces are either trade unionists themselves, or the sons of trade unionists. If they have won any right for themselves in this war it is the right to work, and not the right of preference in work. If they are fighting, as we are told, to make the world a better place to live in, I am sure that they are fighting for a world in which every man who is prepared to toil will be provided with employment without the necessity of any form of preference. "We are aware of the humbug of the Opposition parties following the last war. After that conflict, the great majority of the soldiers upon their discharge from the forces were left to fend for themselves. It was not until a considerable period after the end of the last war that anti-Labour governments displayed any interest in the rehabilitation of the men who served in that war. The preference of employment then extended to returned soldiers carried the qualification "-other things being equal ". However, whenever a job worth having was to be filled other things were never equal. When a pick and shovel job was to be filled or some other job equally laborious, the returned soldier had no great difficulty, particularly during the depression, in obtaining preference from anti-Labour governments; but if the jobs to be filled were really worth having, the qualification " other things being equal " was applied to the detriment of returned soldiers. Honorable members opposite should realize that an issue of this kind, which they hope to capitalize for political purposes, might prove very detrimental to the war effort. The workers in this, and every other country, have been told that this war is a mechanized war; that it is being waged as much by the men in the workshops as by the soldiers on the battlefield. We have encouraged the workers of this country to believe that their job of keeping our mechanical units serviced, and producing munitions and war material is of equal importance to the job being done by the man at the front. Certainly, it can be conceded that workers in the factories do not take the same risk as the men at the front; but it must also be conceded that the jobs which the men are doing on the industrial front are of equal importance to those being done by the soldiers in the front line. I have had an opportunity to study how the policy of preference to returned soldiers works out. I have in mind a case which occurred in a municipality in my electorate. A returned soldier from the last war who was living on his war pension had a son-in-law who. became unemployed. The latter and his wife, because of their straitened circumstances, broke up their home and went to live with his father-in-law. Subsequently, the soninlaw regained the job he formerly occupied. Immediately after he secured the job a protest was made to the municipal council because the man was not a returned soldier. He was again deprived of his job, and the position was given to a man who had relinquished a permanent job in the Tramway Department in 

Order to take that particular position. That case illustrates how the policy of preference to returned soldiers can work out unjustly. In that instance, a man who had a permanent job sought to better himself by exploiting the policy of preference to returned soldiers even to the degree of throwing another man out of work and forcing him to live on the charity of his father-in-law who, as I have said, was a repatriated " digger " of the last war. 

The proposition contained in the amendment might have serious repercussions on the industrial front. I challenge honorable members opposite to deny the fact that the previous Government of which they were members made an agreement with the trade unions, particularly the Amalgamated Engineers Union, which must be repudiated or amended, before the policy of preference to returned soldiers can operate in the way that honorable members opposite now hope to apply it. The trade unions under agreements with a previous government accepted the breaking down of important industrial conditions in order to embrace the dilution scheme. The honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  was a Minister in that Government which agreed with the unions that after this war no word of preference to returned soldiers would be raised, that the dilutees must make way for fully trained tradesmen, who were members of" the unions, and absolute preference of employment was to be given to members of the unions. 

##### Sir Frederick Stewart:

-- How. can the Prime Minister carry out his promise to introduce a measure to implement the principle of preference of employment to returned soldiers if there is any basis for what the honorable member has just said ? 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- I am telling the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  of the agreements with the trade unions entered into by the Government in which he was a Minister. 

##### Sir Frederick Stewart:

-- Ls the honorable member sure that those agreements did not simply settle the question of preference as between members of the union and the dilutees? 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- That is not the case. I am certain that a previous government signed agreements with the trade unions - I mention the Amalgamated Engineers Union specifically - under which, in return for the unions' acceptance of the scheme for the dilution of labour, the 'Government agreed that after the war the dilutees must go out, and absolute preference be given to members of those unions. The honorable member for "Wentworth, who has moved this amendment, was also a Minister in that Government. 

##### Mr Archie Cameron:

-- When were those agreements signed? 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- I am not certain of the date ; but I am certain that every union accepted the dilution of labour under agreements with a previous Government which guaranteed absolute preference of employment to their members after the war. That undertaking is definitely embodied in those agreements. That is why I asked the Prime Minister when he- was speaking what were the implications of any promise of preference employment to returned soldiers with respect to the agreements signed not only by a previous Government but also by this Government. It is all very well for honorable members opposite to attempt now to&gt; walls out on that undertaking to the industrial, workers of this country.  Hon  orable members opposite cannot pat the workers on the back and persuade them to work long hours, and to sacrifice many of the customs and usages in their trade, flattering them into believing that the work they are doing in the factories is equally as valuable in the conduct of the war as the job which the soldiers in the trenches are doing, and then, submit this proposal- which is tantamount to a complete repudiation of the agreements entered into with the trade unions by this Government and a former government. A former government set up reserved occupations and declared that work on the industrial front was just as important as the work which the soldier was doing. That Government, as well as the present Government, prevented certain workers from going to the war. In view of those facts, honorable members opposite must surely realize the repercussions among those workers when they learn that tonight men who were members of a government which made agreements with them have been responsible for this attempt to repudiate those agreements. What will the men in industry think of that proposal, particularly those who desired to join' the forces but were prevented from doing so because they were listed in reserved occupations? What will they think of honorable members opposite who formed the Government which actually set up those reserved occupations, and prevented them from joining the fighting forces? Clearly, the amendment is a complete repudiation by honorable members opposite of the obligations they have entered into with the workers. The honorable member for Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald)**  became very heated when discussing this matter. He was a member of the special committee which investigated this problem. I assume that he agreed with the report, because there is- no evidence that he dissented from it. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The honorable member has exhausted, his time, hut if no other honorable member wishes to speak he may take his second period, now. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- The report reads- 

  >The evidence quoted in paragraph 22 directs attention to the necessity for all reasonable measures- in the* favour of members whereby the handicaps to- which- they are subjected by service can be offset. The committee recommends that it be public policy that wherever practicable preference must be given to members of the forces in the matter of employment. 

Who would imagine, after hearing the speech of the honorable member for Corangamite, that .he subscribed to that view. 

##### Mr McDonald:

--  It is because I subscribe to that view that I spoke as I did. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- The honorable member advocated absolute preference for returned soldiers. 

##### Mr McDonald:

--  I make no apology for that. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- But the honorable member subscribed to the finding of the parliamentary committee, which obviously only favours preference for members of the forces "whereby the handicaps to which they are subjected by service -can be offset ". 

##### Mr McDonald:

--  Nonsense. The special committee decided that, "wherever practicable, preference must be given to members of the forces in the matter of employment ". The honorable member has taken only an extract from the report. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- I quoted the unanimous opinion of the special committee regarding preference for returned soldiers, and the honorable member cannot repudiate it. The report directs attention -  to the necessity for all reasonable measures in favour of members whereby the handicaps to which they are subjected by service can be offset. 

The honorable member was in favour of granting preference only to those men with physical or other handicaps. He cannot delude me. The parliamentary committee recommended that it shall be public policy " wherever practicable " that preference shall be given to members of the forces in the matter of employment. That is similar to the old cause of dispute, namely, " other things being equal ". Although the honorable member subscribed to the report of the parliamentary committee, he has been blatant in his advocacy to-night of complete preference for returned soldiers. But when he did so, he was just as vague as the principle of " preference for returned soldiers " has been to date. 

The Prime Minister referred to the position of merchant seamen. I do not wish to make any invidious comparisons between the services of men who risk their lives, but no section faces greater hazards than the men of the mercantile marine. They are subject to attack from the air, from surface craft, and from submarines, and they have no weapons with which to defend themselves adequately. But nowhere are they described in this bill as members of the Defence Forces. They would not be entitled to the modicum of preference suggested by the honorable member for Wentworth. The great majority of the workers have been prevented from serving in the fighting forces because they are employed in reserved occupations, but they have been prepared to sacrifice their customs and privileges that cost their unions hundreds of thousands, of pounds to gain from arbitration courts. They made those concessions believing that integrity, decency and recognition of contractual obligations still existed, even among the conservative elements of this country. I should like to know what honorable members opposite, who talk so glibly on this matter, think the reactions of the workers will be when they learn of this proposal. Unless those honorable .members have been talking arrant humbug to the members of the fighting forces, the soldiers are entitled to believe that they are fighting to make Australia a better land in which to live. But all that the conservatives have in view for them on their return appears to be preference over other Australians in obtaining employment. They may even bo unfortunate enough -to be governed by gentlemen like the honorable member for Corangamite, who signed a report that qualifies preference to soldiers in a more despicable manner than was done even in the past. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">Barker &middot; ALP</small>

-- When the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  resumed his seat after having given certain assurances to this committee, I considered that it would be advisable for the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison)**  not to press his amendment. But after hearing the speech of the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear)**  I am convinced that the committee must divide on this question.  His  speech was without equal in the annals of this chamber. He made  certain disclosures which were news to some honorable members on this side of the chamber. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- The disclosures were not news to former Ministers. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- We shall require members of the former Government, which some of us supported, to explain why they took this action behind our backs. Preference to unionists in this country will be fought by the Opposition so long as it remains a coherent Opposition; and it still has a lot to do before it becomes coherent. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- A lot of cement will be required for that. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- The honorable member for Dalley has supplied either cement or dynamite for the job. By speaking in the way he did, the honorable member destroyed the effect of everything that the Prime Minister said. He could not have done a greater disservice to the Labour party at this stage than he has done. The purpose of the honorable member for Wentworth was to bring to the notice of the committee the insistent desire of the Opposition that preference to returned soldiers shall be the accepted policy of this country. The honorable member for Wentworth knows,as well as I do, that the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act is administered by a commission. 

##### Mr Johnson:

-- What did the honorable member for Wentworth do when he was Minister for Repatriation? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- His record will bear inspection. 

##### Mr Johnson:

-- What is his record? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- As a recent arrival in this chamber, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie  **(Mr. Johnson)**  would be well advised not to place too much reliance on all the fairy stories that he may hear. It stands to reason that the policy which the honorable member desires the Parliament to accept cannot be carried into effect by regulations. In any case, regulations framed under an act have to be in accordance with the powers granted under the legislation. I shall say no more on that subject, other than to inform the Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt)**  that we are not exactly working in the dark. We are trying to impress upon the Government the seriousness of the situation which confronts it, and to emphasize the earnestness of certain members on this side of the chamber. Our difficulties would have been fewer if the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  when introducing the bill, had announced the intention of the Government to introduce another measure for the purpose of granting preference to returned soldiers. 

##### Mr George Lawson:

-- The honorable member has that assurance from the Prime Minister. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- That assurance was not given when the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill was introduced, though the parliamentary committee recommended the introduction of legislation to grant preference in employment to returned soldiers. Surely, the Minister for Transport  **(Mr. George Lawson)**  does not suggest that the Government's decision to draft the measure was made only since pressure was brought to bear by the Opposition. 

##### Mr Makin:

-- War Cabinet made that decision some time ago. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- That is all the more reason why honorable members should question the omission of that important fact from the speech of the Minister for Repatriation when he introduced this bill. Had he mentioned that intention of the Government, a lot of the difficulty would have been obviated. 

##### Mr Frost:

-- Why does the honorable member think that I should have mentioned it in my second-reading speech, when I knew that the Government was preparing another bill to deal with it? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- A bill to create a trust fund of £30,000,000 was recently introduced here and we were told that it was to be followed by about a dozen more bills. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- Will not the honorable member accept the Prime Minister's assurance now ? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- I should have been willing to do so, and I have argued with my colleagues around me that we should accept it, but after the statement of the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear)**  the Prime Minister's undertaking is now qualified. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- No. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- A completely different set of circumstances has arisen. The speech of the honorable member for Bass  **(Mr. Barnard)**  was bad enough, but the honorable member for Dalley does not talk " through the back of his neck " ; he is one of the most able, persistent and consistent members of the Government party, and when he speaks honorable members on this side are bound to take notice of anything that he says.  His  statement is strictly in accordance with the one he made last year in this chamber when the death duties and other matters were being discussed. To-night the honorable member made perfectly plain the attitude that he and the wing of the Labour party to which he belongs will take. 

##### Mr Conelan:

-- Which wing is that? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- It may be the tail and not the wing, but it has a big effect on the course which the Labour party steers. When the honorable member for Dalley and those who stand with him speak their mind in the Labour party, whether in Parliament or in caucus, some of us on this side know that they are speaking for a very big body of Labour opinion. I therefore say with great regret that it will now be the bounden duty of the Opposition to show exactly where we stand on this question. 

##### Mr Johnson:

-- Does the honorable member favour the amendment moved by the honorable member for Wentworth? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- If the honorable member had been listening he would have known what I favour. The objective of the honorable member for Wentworth is to make it quite clear to the Government, and to the rather red. end of the Labour party which is mixed up with it, that there is on this side a definite demand for preference to returned soldiers. The Attorney-General may refer to the matter being considered when the Commonwealth Powers Bill is fixed up. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- I did not say so. I said that it was going to be brought in next session. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- The right honorable gentleman made a number of references to the powers of the Commonwealth. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- I did. I said that the powers of the Commonwealth might be extended, but that preference would be given to the limit of the Commonwealth's powers. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- There was not the consistency of statement between the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister that there should be. 

##### Dr Evatt:

-- There was absolute consistency. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- Whatever inconsistency there was between them, there is no doubt as to the absolute abyss that exists between the attitude of the Prime Minister on the one hand and the honorable member for Dalley on the other. 

##### Mr George Lawson:

-- The honorable member for Dalley is only one. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- The Government's majority is not very large, and with the shadow of John Thomas Lang over the Labour party in New South Wales a number of us are looking forward to the June conference of the Australian Labour party in Sydney with some interest, and also with some trepidation, because if there is one thing which we do not want in this Parliament it is the presence of J. T. Lang. The statement of the honorable member for Dalley, was a revelation to some of us on this side. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- Let them get up and deny it. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- They can do what they please, but the facts must go on record, and if these agreements have been made the Ministers or ex-Ministers who made them must stand up to what they have done. From my point of view, this is one of the greatest derogations from the policy of the Opposition that I have ever heard of, and one of the greatest slips and blunders, and whoever was responsible must take the blame. 

##### Mr Morgan:

-- On a point of order, I submit that in the division of the act to which the honorable member for Wentworth's amendment refers there is no definition of a member of the forces. Section 22 relates to division 1, in which a member of the forces is defined as one who served during the war of 1914-18. In division 6 a member of the forces is  defined as one who has served during the war which commenced on the 3rd September, 1939. 

##### Mr Francis:

--  Clause 36  of  the bill gives the necessary definition. 

##### Mr Morgan:

--  Not in relation to the division with which we are now dealing. 

##### Dr Evatt:

--  Read clause 36, which contains proposed new section 46. 

##### Mr Morgan:

--  I do not think that meets my point. " Member of the forces" has two definite meanings. It covers those who served in the war of 1914-18 and also those who have served in the present war. For whom is the honorable member for Wentworth seeking preference ? 

##### The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:

-- If the amendment be agreed to, a consequential amendment can be made defining who shall be included. 

##### Mr Morgan:

--  The amendment is confusing as the measure is now framed, because it does not indicate to whom the preference is to be given, and will create discrimination between old and new "diggers ". 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

-- I was not surprised to hear the right honorable the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  state that the Government proposed to introduce a bill giving preference to soldiers in private employment, but I very much regret the statement and'I hope that such a bill will not be introduced. Anybody with experience of the Labour movement and of Australia since the last war, especially the years immediately after it, will recognize that no more potent apple of discord could be thrown into the ranks of Labour than the  issue  of preference to soldiers. That issue may be looked at in two ways. Preference may be given by Commonwealth and State Governments and public bodies, municipalities and so on, in  filling  employments directly under their control, either permanently or temporarily. The Commonwealth itself, as regards its own services, has no doubt power to legislate and has always applied the principle of preference. The State Governments, municipalities and public bodies have tended, at any rate in  Victoria,  to apply the principle of preference without any legal command. In 

New South Wales they do so under tl] operation of law. But that is distinct from the notion of preference in private employment. That issue was raised immediately after the last war with, in my opinion, no other object than to divide the workers and keep them divided. It was very successful in doing so. In New South Wales in 1919 an act was placed on the statute-book providing for preference, but in Victoria there has never been a law compelling employers to give preference to soldiers over non-soldiers in employment. Even in New South Wales it appears to have been held that, although the employer could be compelled to give preference to a soldier in engagement, he might dismiss him the next day. He was not bound to continue his employment, and, although that defect existed, the act was not amended. The Government now says that although it contemplates the fullest measure of employment for every body after the war, it intends to introduce a measure compelling the private employer to give preference to the ex-member of the forces over the person who has not served. Apart altogether from the potent considerations urged by the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear),**  I wish to emphasize these others: There will be a far greater number of ex-members of the forces after this war than there were after the last war. There will be a very great number of persons engaged in industry who will be ex-servicemen. It is desirable that legislation should be passed to provide that their employers should reinstate them, and the last Government did introduce regulations providing for the reinstatement of ex-soldiers in civil employment. That is perfectly reasonable, but it is, in my view, wrong to say that the numerous persons who have returned from the war are to be found employment at the expense of persons who have not gone to the war, because the effect of that is immediately to create two rival classes of workers. I cannot conceive of anything more injurious to the working classes and the Labour movement of this country than to divide them, whether on religious or racial ground, or by distinguishing between military and non-military service. That is a very dangerous policy, and I think that the Labour movement outside will be astounded to hear that the Prime Minister proposes to compel private employers to give preference to ex-soldiers over non-soldiers. I go a certain length with the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison)**  in saying that, if there is to be preference to unionists, the soldiers' rights should be protected. I agree with that, and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that no award of preference to unionists can be made to the prejudice of returned soldiers. Section 81a of that act provides - 

  >Nothing in any award or order made under this act, or in1 any agreement relating to industrial matters, shall operate to prevent the employment of returned soldiers or sailors. 

Then follows the definition of returned soldiers. The effect is that, in those rare cases in which the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has awarded preference to unionists, it has made quite clear that preference is subject to the rights of returned soldiers, who are to be employed on the same basis as unionists, even although they may not themselves be unionists. In a waterside workers case it transpired that on the waterfront the firstpreference was given to soldier unionists, and second preference to unionists who were not soldiers, and to soldier nonunionists on an equal footing. That is the only law operating under federal authority in Victoria dealing with that matter. There is no State legislation so far as I am aware - and I am fairly familiar with the subject - that gives any preference to soldiers in private employment in Victoria, or protects their rights in any way. If there is to be preference to unionists, then there should be provision that they should not get preference over returned soldiers. If there is to be compulsory unionism, there should be a provision preventing it from operating to the prejudice of the ex-soldier nonunionist. My experience, and I think that it is the experience of the Minister for Health  **(Mr. Holloway),**  is that upon the basis of the claim for preference to soldiers there were built up by unscrupulous men unions which were fighting the genuine unions in the interests of the employers. Ex-soldiers were gathered into those unions on the assumption that they were going to get preference because they were soldiers. The soldiers had no reason to be at enmity with the unions, because the unions took a very prominent part in the rehabilitation of the soldiers. Without worrying whether ex-soldiers were unionists or non-unionists, they helped all and did what they could to see that they were taught trades. The result of that and other measures is that in Victoria, where there has been no preference to soldiers, the unions and the returned soldiers have got on well.. In the trade union movement in Victoria some of the best and strongest and most militant unionists are men who served in the last war. I believe that when the men come back from this war, the bulk of them will want to join the unions, but if the promise of preference to soldiers in private employment is held out to them, there will again be people organizing unions of soldiers only, and saying to them, " Do not join the ordinary unions of wage-earners, but join the union of soldiers only, because by joining it you can get preference over non-soldiers ". That is very dangerous ; it is one of the things that a fascist government would introduce. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

, - I am astonished at the revelation of the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear),**  and the definite assertion of the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn),**  that they are opposed to preference to returned soldiers. Normally, I should readily have accepted the statement of the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin),**  and I was prepared to do so to-night. I asked my colleagues to accept his undertaking that he would introduce in the next period of the session a bill to grant preference to returned soldiers. But we have heard the only two private members on the Government side who have spoken state their opposition to the principle. 

##### Mr Beck:

--  The honorable members for Reid  **(Mr. Morgan)**  and Bass  **(Mr. Barnard)**  have said the same thing.' 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- I shall not weaken one iota on the report that I have signed. It has no qualification, and is as emphatic as it was possible to make it. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

--  Read paragraph 51. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- The paragraph reads - 

  >The evidence quoted in paragraph 22 directs attention to the necessity for all reasonable measures in the favour of members whereby the handicaps to which they are subjected by service can be offset. The committee recommends that it be public policy that wherever practicable preference must bc given to members of the forces in the matter of employment. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- It refers only to men who are handicapped. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- It does not. Let me deal with the handicaps that are occasioned by active service. I should not have thought that it would be necessary in this Parliament to give examples of them. Every body ought to have the greatest appreciation of all that our service men are doing, and the handicaps against which they are standing up so wonderfully on our behalf. The handicaps are mentioned in the evidence of Lieutenant-Colonel R. P&gt;. Madgwick, Director of Education and Vocational Training in the Department of the Army, who said - 

  >We have taken men out of their normal civil employments and have changed them fundamentally. We have removed the motives that would actuate them in their civil life. We have taken from them all striving to gain a livelihood. Shortly, we have changed them; they are different social beings. In the course of that process of change, we have put them into an environment in which they cannot get a full appreciation of the changes that are occurring in the economic and social structure. The}' have new interests which occupy the greater part of their time, and do not know what is taking place in the environment in which they formerly lived. At the same time, that environment itself is changing very rapidly. Australia is now going in for secondary industry. We are producing process workers, or men and women with a degree of skill rather greater than that of a process worker, in our munitions training schemes, dilutee schemes, &amp;c. Those men who are skilled tradesmen or process workers have two major advantages over the men in the Army. In the first place, they are maintaining and increasing their skill; and, in the second place, they are working in a changing economy, and are understanding the changes by reason of their participation in them. The man in the Army is losing his skill and is not being given the training that is being given to the ordinary civilian population. Therefore, when he returns to civil life he will have lost a good deal of the skill that he formerly possessed and will certainly not have been trained for all of those new trades that developed during the war. 

Those are the handicaps. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- Paragraph 51 says that only the handicapped men shall be given preference. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- All soldiers are handicapped. Many men will return shattered and torn, or suffering from war neurosis. They will be entirely changed men because of the privations, the strain, the difficulties, and the enormous problems with which they have had to contend. They will be entitled to the best that we can give to them. Preference will be only a beginning. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- Explain the meaning of "where practicable". 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- Every soldier who takes part in this war will have all the handicaps, without exception, to which the paragraph refers. The honorable member for Dalley has asked me to explain the meaning of the recommendation " that it be public policy that whereever practicable preference must be given to members of the forces ". After long discussion and consideration, the expression " where practicable " was adopted in order to overcome the objectionable humbug of " all things being equal " which was attached to preference after the last war. The object is that preference to all returned soldiers shall be absolute. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- " Where practicable " means the same as " all things being equal ". 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- It means absolute preference, without the previous handicap of " all things being equal ". That is what the committee wanted to achieve. Every member of it will admit that, without reservation. I am certain that the honorable members for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard),**  Corangamite  **(Mr. McDonald),**  and Newcastle  **(Mr. Watkins),**  will endorse my statement. All of us strove to frame a new phrase which would destroy the old condition " all things being equal ". If, in the opinion of the honorable member for Dalley, that is not conveyed by the language, I assure him that it was what the committee wished to achieve. I do not deviate one iota from the stand that there shall be absolute preference. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- The honorable gentleman must speak for himself. I stand for the giving of preference where practicable. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- The honorable gentleman knows as well as I do the length of time we devoted to the attempt to wipe out the condition " all things being equal ". That was the object of paragraph 51. The honorable gentleman has endorsed what I have said. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- Nothing of the sort. I say that " absolute preference " is qualified by " where practicable ". 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- I do not wish to embarrass any member of the committee. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- The honorable member is not embarrassing me. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- We set out to do our utmost to get away from "all things being equal". 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- And substituted " where practicable ". Does the honorable member say that "where practicable " is mandatory, and means that returned soldiers must be given preference ? 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- Let me put it in my own way. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- The honorable member says that all the members of the committee wanted to do the same thing. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- All of us wanted to do away with the handicap imposed after the last war, of having attached to preference the condition "all things being equal ". 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- It has been definitely supplanted by another handicap. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- I have said that I stand absolutely for preference to returned .soldiers. I began with that, and I end with it. That is the recommendation of the committee, so far as I am concerned. I had asked the honorable member for Wentworth not to proceed with his amendment, but to accept the undertaking of the Prime Minister. However, the speeches of the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear),**  the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn),**  the honorable member for Reid  **(Mr. Morgan)**  and the honorable member for Bass  **(Mr. Barnard),**  who have declared themselves to be opposed to preference, alter the situation entirely. With them, the Government's majority of two is gone, and preference to returned soldiers is gone also unless we exert pressure on the Government. 1 support the amendment, and I intend to continue to fight for preference. 

##### Mr BECK:<br><small class="text-muted">Denison</small>

.When the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison)**  moved his amendment I rather regretted his action, because I did not believe that this was a matter for which provision should be made by regulation. But the Government is right in saying that it should be dealt with by legislation. However, when we hear speeches of the kind made by some honorable members on the Government side, we realize that, however honest the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  may be in his intentions, it is necessary for him to get his proposal through caucus before he can present it to the House. I know that the honorable member for Bass  **(Mr. Barnard)**  is in favour of doing everything possible for returned soldiers, but his first duty is to the unionists. 

##### Mr Barnard:

-- The honorable member knows that several members of my family are volunteers in the forces. 

##### Mr BECK:

-- I am aware of that. I also know that the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  has sons in the forces, and he naturally desires that full repatriation benefits shall be available to them. I am not now blaming the Government over this matter, but some of the Government's supporters. I do not believe that any honorable members opposite are opposed to the interests of returned soldiers, but they are bound more by their duty to the trade unions. 

##### Mr Frost:

-- The honorable member is trying to make political capital out of the issue. Why not accept the word of the Prime Minister? 

##### Mr BECK:

-- I should be prepared to accept it but for the fact that the members of his own party may not allow him to do as he would wish. 

##### Mr Conelan:

-- That is not true. 

##### Mr BECK:

-- It is true that the loyalty of honorable members opposite is pledged to those whom they represent. There are four honorable members opposite- 

##### Mr Conelan:

-- 'Who are they? 

##### Mr BECK:

-- The honorable member for Reid  **(Mr. Morgan),**  the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn),**  the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear),**  and. the honorable member for Bass  **(Mr. Barnard)**  have declared themselves against preference to returned soldiers. I stand for such preference in all circumstances, and, therefore, I feel bound to support the amendment. 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wentworth</small>

.. - Had it not been for something which occurred to-night I should have been prepared to accept the assurances of the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  and to have paid some heed to the statements of the Attorney-General  **(Dr. Evatt).**  The Attorney-General said that my amendment was a crude way in which to provide for preference to returned soldiers. Then the Prime Minister came in, and told the committee that War Cabinet had reached a decision on this matter, and the Minister for Munitions  **(Mr. Makin)**  also gave an assurance. We  Were  told that legislation was well on the way to give preference to returned soldiers. However, a little incident that occurred much earlier in the evening caused me to entertain some doubts. I understand that the Attorney-General approached an honorable member on this side, who subsequently approached my leader, who, in turn, told me that if I would let my amendment go, preference to returned soldiers would be the first thing to be referred to by the Standing Committee on Repatriation after its appointment. If War Cabinet has reached a decision and legislation is being prepared, what need is there to refer the subject to a parliamentary committee not yet appointed ? 

##### Mr FROST:

--  Where did the honorable member get all that from? 

##### Mr HARRISON:

-- From the leader of our party, and the proposal came from the Attorney-General through the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis).**  I wonder who is trying to hoodwink honorable members? I am afraid that we may have the same experience in regard to preference to returned soldiers as we had over the Defence Bill. That issue was decided, not by Parliament, but by the Federal Conference of the Labour party, which the Prime Minister approached for permission before introducing the bill. I fear that the unions will not allow the Prime Minister to introduce legislation to give preference to returned soldiers. Therefore, it is necessary for some one to safeguard the interests of the men who are fighting overseas, especially as the trend of the Government now is in the direction of preference to unionists. A bill was introduced recently into the Parliament of New South Wales to give preference to unionists. It has been held up temporarily, but, as it was a government measure, it will be brought on again. I repeat that if there is to be preference to unionists there should also be preference to returned soldiers. 

##### Mr FRoST:

--  Will the honorable member admit the truth of what the honorable member for Dalley said about the previous Government signing up with the unions ? 

##### Mr HARRISON:

-- I do not admit it. The honorable member for Dalley made a mistake. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

--  Let the honorable member for Fawkner  **(Mr. Holt)**  get up and deny it. 

##### Mr Holt:

--  I do deny it. 

##### Mr HARRISON:

-- I agree with the honorable member for Dalley that the qualification " all things- being equal " largely nullified the provision for preference to returned soldiers of the last war, and for that reason I have made my amendment as broad as possible so as to place beyond doubt that there shall be preference to returned soldiers. Even if my amendment be agreed to, it can be repealed, later if the Government brings down legislation for the purpose of giving preference to returned soldiers. The parliamentary committee has expressed itself in favour of this principle being embodied in the act, and therefore I see no reason why I should not press my amendment. 

##### Mr Curtin:

--  Will the honorable member help me to understand why this provision has not been in the Repatriation Act during the last twenty years ? 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; UAP; LP from 1944</small>

-- It was included in the Arbitration Act in 1918. The honorable member for Batman  **(Mr. Brennan),**  who spoke on the 20th December, 1918, said - 

  >I do not admit that the soldiers returning to this country are desirous to take advantage of some section in an act of parliament to place themselves in a position, in the world of industrial competition, of advantage against their fellow workers, or to be put in a position where inducement is held out to them not to join industrial organizations. Although the policy of the Commonwealth Government on all sides has been one of industrial organization, this clause is an invitation to our returning soldiers not to join unions, and thus aid in the peaceful solution of industrial trouble. 

Therefore, we know where he stands on the issue. 

##### Mr Curtin:

-- This Parliament has no power to compel an employer to discriminate between applicants for employment. 

##### Mr HARRISON:

-- I want it to be laid down unequivocally that this Parliament endorses the principle of preference to returned soldiers. When the Prime Minister brings that down I shall give him all the help that lies in my power to see that the provision I desire to have inserted in this bill is repealed. In the light of the statements made by honorable members opposite to-night, in view of opinions expressed in the past by the honorable member for Batman  **(Mr. Brennan),**  and having regard to the inclusion of the principle of preference to unionists in other legislation, it is necessary to divide the committee on my amendment. 

##### Mr HOLT:<br><small class="text-muted">Fawkner</small>

.- I understand that the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear)**  referred to what were- alleged to be agreements made by previous governments with various trade unions which preserved the rights of those bodies in the post-war period. The only agreements of which I have knowledge are those relating to the dilution of skilled tradesmen. Are those the agreements to which, the honorable member for Dalley referred ? 

##### Mr Rosevear:

-- Yes. 

##### Mr HOLT:

-- Honorable members are familiar with the general scheme under which dilution was arranged. The details are set out in Statutory Rule No. 102 of 1941, which embodied the National Security (Engineering Trades Dilution) Regulations. Regulation 3 states - 

  >The objects of these regulations are to give effect to the principle embodied in, and to supplement the agreements made by, the Commonwealth with the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Australasian Society of Engineers and certain organizations of employers on the 8th May, 1940, and on the 13th June, 1940, respectively, to meet the exceptional circumstances arising in the engineering trades out of the present war, and these regulations shall be administered accordingly. 

I invite the Prime Minister to table the agreements so that honorable members will be able to read every clause in them. In view of the allegation made it is desirable that that be done at the earliest possible opportunity. Those agreements were made with the Government of which I was a Minister, and the committee is entitled to the details. 

##### Mr Curtin:

-- The honorable member had plenty of time to table them. 

##### Mr HOLT:

-- They were never asked for. 

##### Mr Curtin:

-- The regulations could have been disallowed if they had been tabled. 

##### Mr HOLT:

-Surely the right honorable gentleman will not split straws over the matter. 

##### Mr Curtin:

-- I shall certainly table the agreements. 

##### Mr HOLT:

-- No attempt has been made to conceal the fact that the agreements were made. They followed in principle, and almost in verbiage, similar agreements made by the Government of Great Britain with the engineering trades, and the principles applied to the engineering trades were carried through the artisan trades generally. The tradesmen, to whom reference was made, were men who in the main had gone through an apprenticeship of 5,  *5$*  or 6 years, much as a doctor has a period of training of about 6 years. During that time the men are paid apprenticeship rates, and at the end of the period, provided that they qualify, and pass their trade tests, they became fully fledged tradesmen. The history of  these trades goes back into the Middle Ages. The guilds which were established for their protection furnished proof of the way in which these crafts jealously guarded their industrial rights. One of the difficulties which the Government with which I was associated was faced in organizing the tremendous expansion of the munitions programme was the shortage of skilled tradesmen at that time. The quantity of secondary production, particularly in the metal trades, before the war, was inadequate. 

##### Mr Curtin:

--  If a tradesman is available in the post-war period he must be given work in preference to the dilutee. 

##### Mr HOLT:

-- Yes, that is his position in brief. The shortage was real. The position was such as would have arisen if 10,000 doctors had been required and only 2,000 were available. Under emergency conditions it would be necessary for 8,000 medical students to be rushed through their course in twelve months or two years, and allowed to function alongside fully qualified medical men, and, in consideration of the doctors accepting this invasion of their profession, they would have to be assured that, after the war, the 8,000 men who had come in during the war would not have rights as against those which the original 2,000 enjoyed. That is what was arranged with regard to the skilled trades. The agreements provided that a register was to be kept of all the dilutees as they came into the trades. Local dilution committees were set up, and the reason for having a register was because the principle that the last to come should be the first to go, in the event of the skilled industries meeting difficulties after the war, was accepted. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

--  And so the honorable member got back to preference to unionists. 

##### Mr HOLT:

-- That matter, as the honorable member has discussed it, was never raised at any stage of the proceedings. The regulations provided an arrangement as between tradesmen doing the job and the men who were brought in under the dilution arrangement. There are many engineers in the forces at present, and surely it is not suggested that after the war they are not to enjoy rights equal to those of the skilled tradesmen who remained in the trade. Regulation 21 of Statutory Rules 1941, No. 102, states - 

  >Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, nothing in these regulations should be construed as depriving any employer or employee of any rights .under any industrial award, agreement or determination. 

##### Sir Frederick Stewart:

--  The regulations did not nullify the preference to soldiers. 

##### Mr HOLT:

-- Certainly not. The scheme under the agreement was fundamentally and essentially one dealing with the respective rights of the tradesman and the dilutee who was being brought in under the dilution agreement. "Whatever the honorable member for Dalley may attempt to read into it, as far as the government of the day and the trade unions were concerned, the matter of preference to returned men was never, to my knowledge, raised and never became an issue in the discussion. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:<br><small class="text-muted">Dalley</small>

-- I shall not quarrel with the historical record given by the honorable member for Fawkner  **(Mr. Holt),**  who is an exMinister for Labour and National Service. What he has said is correct. In the highly skilled engineering trade, the employees had served an apprenticeship on low wages, and they jealously guarded their rights- 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- The honorable member for Dalley has already spoken twice on the amendment, and may not now make a third speech. 

##### Mr JOHNSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Kalgoorlie</small>

-- I regret that the amendment has been submitted. It states that regulations should be made providing for the granting of preference in employment to the members of the forces. That matter should be deferred, because of the implications of the amendment. It makes no provision for many men who are playing an important part in the war effort - members of the Volunteer Defence Corps like those whom I have seen north of Port Hedland travelling, at their own expense, 30.0 miles to attend camp. Neither does it make any provision for servicewomen. This matter is too important to be dealt with in an amendment of the Repatriation Act, and I therefore urge the committee to set it aside for the time being in order that the .Government may be able to bring down the necessary legislation to deal with it, I appeal with all sincerity to the honorable member for "Wentworth to withdraw his amendment. He cannot hope to achieve by it what ought to be his objective, for he has made no mention of the thousands of men who are debarred by the man-power authorities from leaving munitions factories to join the fighting forces. 

##### Mr Rankin:

--  The honorable member cannot compare munitions workers and members of the Volunteer Defence Corps with the men who are fighting in New Guinea. " 

##### Mr JOHNSON:

-- This measure provides for the repatriation of our forces. Employment is another matter which ought to be dealt with in separate legislation. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; Fremantle &middot; ALP</small>

-- The basic aim of this bill is provision for those who have been incapacitated in war. It deals with the provision that the country shall make so that they shall be assured of a certain income, certain treatment, and certain other services in order that their incapacity may not be so acute to them personally as to deprive them of the ordinary amenities of life which they would be able to get if they could work. That is the basis of the bill. It is not a bill to decide the conditions of employment or qualifications for employment, or to deal with the relationship of employer to employee, or to do anything else connected with the regulation of industry. I submit to the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison)**  that he  13  doing a disservice to returned soldiers by attempting to judge how and by what means there shall be assured employment for the fit, and the right kind of employment for the partially fit, and what generally shall be the relationship of the men and women who have served Australia to industry as a whole. Under the existing powers of this Parliament, no regulation which' we could gazette could be made applicable to any private person, unless he was engaged in war work. 

Under present conditions, this Parliament can have no authority over post-war work. The right place in which to put the honorable member's amendment would be the Public Service Act, but ever since the last war that act has contained a section which provides for preference to returned soldiers in employment. I have already intimated that Cabinet has advanced this matter to the stage of preparing a hill, for submission to Parliament - a stage never reached by any previous government. I shall not condemn previous governments on that account, because the problem now is of much greater magnitude than it ever was in the past. 

##### Mr Harrison:

--  I did not like the trickiness of the Attorney-General in trying to get me to withdraw my amendment by saying something which is not borne out by what the right honorable gentleman says. 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- The honorable member is on nice points. He wants a division so that he may be able to refer to it at public meetings. I am concerned with the practical problems. I regard it  a3  a national duty to have those practical problems resolved in a much more deliberate way and in accordance with the forms of Parliament. Legislation would give to Parliament far more enforcible authority than a regulation could ever give. I appeal to the honorable gentlemen who have shared the burden of the preparation of this bill and to the committee not to mix things that ought to be kept distinct. The problem of organization of employment is basic. It is my hope, and it should be the prayer of all, that when this war is finished we shall have so arranged things that every decent citizen shall have work to do if he is fit to do it. Some have been compelled to serve at home, because Parliament has declared that to be their best service; some have gone to fight, others have gone to sea in ships. The pilots who have flown civil transport aircraft have engaged in a most hazardous vocation vitally related to the capacity of the country to win the war. All must be assured of work. Those who are not trained to enter a trade or a profession shall be trained and those who are not fit shall be made as fit as human ingenuity can make them. I hope that there will be an administration at that time with the requisite sympathy and understanding and courage to make whatever provision may be necessary to tide those men over that period. I am advised on the best of authority that they should be given some work, even part time work, so that they shall not be left to brood in loneliness which would breed neurasthenia. I am also told that it would be equally bad just to give them the dole. There are infinite problems in this question of what is to be done in the interests of all. Our proposal contained in the Commonwealth Powers Bill is not merely the repatriation of the returned soldiers but their replacement in the civil order. 

##### Mr Holt:

--  Rehabilitation. 

##### Mr CURTIN:

-- Yes. The magnitude of our task in that respect is so great that I ask honorable members to make it their high duty and to treat it as a problem separate and distinct from repatriation. 

Question put -

AYES

Question resolved in the negative. 

Clause agreed to. 

Clauses 38 and 39 agreed to. 

Clause 40 - 

  >Section sixty of the Principal Act is repealed, and the following section is inserted in its stead :  - " (60. - (1.) The Governor-General may make regulations . . . providing for the granting of assistance and benefits - 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- I move - 

  >That, in proposed new section 60 (1.), after paragraph(g), the following paragraph be inserted: -  *"*  (ga) by way of free medical treatment to members of the Forces for a period of twelve months after discharge from service; and". 

Section 60 of the principal act enables regulations to be made for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the act. The several purposes are set out in paragraphs  *a*  to  *h.*  The amendment proposes that free medical treatment shall be available to members of the forces for a period of twelve months after their discharge. I believe that such a provision would prove to be a wise investment on the part of the Government, because if proper treatment be given to these men. during the period mentioned, there will beless danger of their contracting disabilities in later years. The amendment means only that power will be given to make regulations along the lines indicated. I should like to know whether the Minister is prepared to accept it. 

##### Mr RYAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Flinders</small>

.- I support the amendment. When the war is over many men who during their war service have contracted malaria will return, and it is likely that, although temporarily cured, they will have  further attacks after their discharge. The granting of free medical treatment in these and similar cases covered by the amendment is justified and would be a sound policy. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- The Government cannot accept the amendment. As I dealt with this matter in my secOndreading speech it is not necessary to repeat what I said then. The Government has considered this proposal, and similar requests were dealt with by previous governments. I point out that adequate facilities exist for the treatment in repatriation institutions of ailments which can properly be ascribed to war service, both in this war and in the last war. As has been indicated previously, three months' hospital treatment is given, if necessary, to a member prior to his discharge from the Service. That period may be extended to six months, or twelve months in certain cases, even though the disability or disease is in no way associated with war service. A committee of Parliamentary ex-service men made representations to the Prime Minister that free medical or hospital treatment should be given in respect of disabilities suffered by members of the forces who are receiving war pensions at the general rate for total incapacity under the first schedule to the act, or at special rates under the second schedule. As honorable members will recall, I made a statement in this chamber on the 9th March, in which I indicated that the Government approved the request under certain conditions. Now the honorable member for "Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  wants to go farther, and' to provide free treatment for every body. The Government .cannot accept his proposal. One important factor, which should not be overlooked is that of hospital accommodation. In order to conserve materials and man-power, and in anticipation of certain hospital accommodation becoming available after the termination of hostilities, the construction of additional repatriation hospitals has been restricted to what is regarded as a reasonable minimum. On the basis that the principle to be followed is treatment for disabilities caused by the war it is probable that 800,000 persons will become potentially eligible lor treatment. Even with the hospital accommodation which may become available after the termination of hostilities by the transfer of service hospitals to the Repatriation Department, it is unlikely that there will be any accommodation available for disabilities not due to war service. 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wentworth</small>

-- I support the amendment, which has much to commend it. Men are accepted for service on the basis of 100 per cent, physical fitness. They are then trained as commandos, shock troops, and in other ways in order to fit them for fighting under difficult conditions such as exist in jungle country where mud, tropical diseases and other difficulties have to be contended with. There is always the risk of contracting malaria. Latent diseases may develop because of infection of the blood stream. When these men return they will be discharged after only a cursory medical examination, but they may still be liable to suffer disabilities caused by the conditions under which they have had to live. Many of these men will break down in health, and unless some provision be made for them along the lines of the amendment, they will have to pay their own medical expenses. They will have no right of appeal to the Repatriation Commission because they will have been discharged as medically fit. After they have expended all that they possess in seeking, to restore their health,, they "may, at last, become a charge on the State, in which event the cost to the State will be much greater than the cost of any medical service that they may be given in the first twelve months after their discharge. These are factors which the Minister should take into consideration. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- It is only fair to assume that any illness contracted by a soldier within twelve months of his discharge is attributable to his war service, and therefore I. cannot understand why a Minister in a Labour Government refuses to accept the amendment. 

##### Mr Makin:

-- The medical treatment set out in the amendment will be included in the- Government's medical scheme. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- I am amazed that a Labour government should refuse to accept a proposal of this kind. Honorable members opposite have always protested that past governments would not do so because they were tight fisted. 

##### Mr FRosT:

--  We did not say that they would not do it, but, simply, that they did not do it. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- Here is an opportunity for the present Government to do it. It is about time that honorable members opposite lived up to their statements that we should make our country a land fit for heroes to live in. When the Government refuses to accept a proposal of this kind one becomes tired of hearing  such  statements. Very little cost would be involved in implementing the amendment. 

##### Mr BARNARD:<br><small class="text-muted">Bass</small>

.I am greatly surprised at the attitude adopted by the honorable member for Warringah.  His  insincerity in moving this amendment is obvious, because when he was a Minister in previous governments, he did not attempt to have repatriation benefits extended along the lines he now suggests. The honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison),**  who, at one time, was Minister for Repatriation, also failed to extend repatriation benefits in this way. I regard the clause as adequate. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">It is all very well for honorable members opposite to smile, and say that past governments which we on this side supported, failed to extend repatriation benefits as is proposed in the amendment. We have not been in office since Japan came into the war, and up to that time no Australian soldier was required to serve in malaria-infested countries like New Guinea. Very few men who serve in the tropics will escape that disease. Indeed, some hospital ships are crowded with malaria cases on every return voyage from the northern battle zone. Those men will require attention not for twelve months but for the remainder of their lives. The Minister for the Navy (Mr. Makin &middot; Parkes i [5.50 a.m.].</small>

interjected that such cases will be embraced by the proposed national welfare scheme. Apparently, the Government is prepared to provide benefits in cases of this kind only as a part of some general scheme which has nothing whatever to do with repatriation. I repeat that soldiers who contract malaria should be afforded adequate medical treatment for at least twelve months after the date of their discharge from the forces. 

##### Mr Makin:

--  They will be adequately covered. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- Surely, the Minister for the Navy does not suggest that soldiers suffering from malaria should be obliged to wait for this treatment until such time as the Government's proposed national welfare scheme is put into operation. We do not yet know the details of that scheme. At all events, if the Government is prepared to provide treatment for these cases under some general welfare scheme, it admits the wisdom of the amendment. Therefore, it should make this provision under this bill rather than under a measure not related to . repatriation. Men who contract malaria will never be entirely free of the disease. 

##### Mr Holloway:

--  Why limit the treatment to a period of twelve months? 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I know of many soldiers who contracted malaria in the last war and failed to obtain repatriation benefit. After all, the commission can only give effect to the law as it stands. 

##### Mr Conelan:

--  Provision is made under the act to .cover cases of malaria. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- That is only in respect, of incapacity; but many sufferers from malaria are only temporarily incapacitated as the result of the disease. In addition, sufferers from this complaint will be unable to obtain drugs of the same quality as were available even up to twelve months ago. 

##### Mr Conelan:

--  Those drugs have been frozen in order to conserve supplies for the treatment of soldiers. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- One of my sons, who is in the fighting forces, has told me that the drugs are unobtainable. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. 


 **Mr.** HOLLOWAY  (Melbourne PortsMinister for Social Services and Min  astonished at some of the statements made by the honorable member for Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr)**  who should be fully acquainted with the provisions of the Repatriation Act. He knows that no soldier who suffers from malaria, or from any other disease, is refused treatment by the commission even, if necessary, for the remainder of his life. Thousands of soldiers who served in the last war are still receiving treatment at the expense of the commission. Some of them will not be able to stand erect again. The amendment is unnecessary. It almost casts a slur upon the Repatriation Commission. Even if the commission had been a little remiss in the past - and I do not say that it has refused to treat men - surely our experience of repatriation during the last 25 years, and the present amendments of the act, will result in more sympathetic treatment of the soldier. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- Does the Repatriation Commission now provide free medical treatment for a soldier for twelve months after his discharge? If so, what is the Minister's objection to the amendment? 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- What good purpose will the amendment serve ? 

##### Mr Spender:

-- The Minister is engaging in a sham fight. 

##### Mr Conelan:

-- And the honorable member for Warringah is engaging in legal quibbles. 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:

-- It is wise to ask the mover of an amendment to explain why he submitted it. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- I submitted the amendment because returned soldiers do not get free medical treatment for twelve months after their discharge, regardless of whether their complaint is attributable to war service. 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:

-- I prefer to reverse that argument. Why is it necessary to insist upon free medical treatment for a period of twelve months after discharge when the soldier oan obtain twenty years' free treatment if he needs it? 

##### Mr Spender:

-- But he cannot. 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:

-- He can. There is no necessity for the amendment. The honorable member, because of his previous disappointment, is now trying desperately to find consolation in having one amendment. accepted. He knows that all soldiers receive free treatment when they are in need of it. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- They do not. That is an amazing statement. 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:

-- When a soldier becomes ill as the result of his service in the last war, he can obtain free treatment. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- My amendment provides that a soldier may obtain free treatment for a period of twelve months after his discharge, irrespective of whether his complaint is attributable to war service. 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:

-- The amendment is unnecessary because every soldier, who needs free medical treatment, can obtain it from the Repatriation Commission. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">REID, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

.Whilst I have no doubt that the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  is actuated by the highest motives in submitting the amendment, I agree with the Minister for Health  **(Mr. Holloway)**  that the enactment of the amendment would defeat the honorable member's purpose. The Minister pointed out that under present conditions, medical benefits for incapacitated soldiers may continue for many years. Personally, I consider that those medical benefits should be granted for an indefinite period to returned soldiers, regardless of whether they are incapacitated, as part of a national health scheme. If the amendment be accepted, it will limit all medical benefits available to soldiers to a period of twelve months after their discharge. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- That is not correct. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- That will be the effect of the amendment, because the honorable member has not differentiated between incapacitated soldiers and others. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- Incapacitated soldiers are now eligible to receive free treatment under the existing act. 

##### Mr MORGAN:

-- The amendment, if adopted, will limit the period of free treatment to twelve months after the soldier is discharged. The honorable member suggested that the necessary power should be taken by regulation; but authority to issue regulations is already  established in section 60 of the principal act. I hope that the honorable member will withdraw the amendment. 

##### Mr RYAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Flinders</small>

.- The Minister for Health  **(Mr. Holloway)**  gave the committee to understand that all men discharged from the Army will be eligible to receive medical benefits regardless of whether their illness is due  to  war service. 

##### Mr Holloway:

--  I said that every Australian soldier who requires medical treatment when he returns to this country, can obtain it, if necessary, for twenty years. 

##### Mr RYAN:

-- The Minister did not make it clear whether the illness had to be due to war service. The amendment is designed to make all soldiers eligible to receive this benefit for a period of twelve months after their discharge, regardless of whether their indisposition is due to war service. The Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  said that all soldiers will be eligible to receive this treatment for three months or six months or even longer, if it is found that their illness is due to war service. If a soldier nine months after his discharge, applies for medical treatment, how can it be proved that his ailment is due to war service? Will be have' to appear before a tribunal? If so, he will have to submit to medical examination and the position will become very complicated. The adoption of the amendment will simplify. the problem. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">Parkes</small>

.- The Minister for Health  **(Mr. Holloway)**  declared that a soldier is entitled to free medical treatment whenever he becomes ill. That is not correct. 

##### Mr Holloway:

-- Hi3 illness must be clue to war service. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- When a soldier  i3  taken ill, he has no opportunity to appear before the tribunal, unless he can be transported there by ambulance. 

##### Mr Makin:

--  The honorable member based his case on malaria patients. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I can cite other cases. If a man has spondylitis, he is still required to prove that the illness is d due to war service. 

##### Mr Holloway:

--  Why does the honorable member consider that free medical treatment should be limited to a period of twelve months after the soldier has been discharged ? 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- The health of every soldier will he somewhat impaired as the result of the stress of battle conditions. A soldier, suffering from neurasthenia, may take a fit in a street. The Repatriation Commission has no power to grant free medical treatment to every soldier who has been discharged and becomes ill. Before he can obtain this benefit, he must convince the tribunal that his ailment is due to war service. Some cases have been accepted immediately, but hundreds have been rejected. A quartermaster-sergeant who served under my command lived in Hobart for eight years after he had been granted his discharge and every three or four months he suffered from severe attacks of malaria. He was not eligible to receive a pension or free medical benefits. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  Nearly every soldier who has taken part in the campaign in New Guinea will suffer from malarial fever. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- One hospital ship is engaged exclusively in bringing malaria cases from New Guinea to Australia. 

##### Mr Makin:

--  All of those sufferers will be eligible to receive the benefits of this legislation. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- Malaria may lie dormant for months after the soldier has been discharged, and he will not be entitled to receive free treatment until he proves to the satisfaction of the commission that his condition is due to war service. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  The whole structure of repatriation would be broken down if the Government accepted cases other than those due to war service. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- The amendment provides that free medical treatment shall be granted to all soldiers for a period of twelve months after their discharge. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  If at the end of twelve months the patient was in hospital suffering from other than a war disability, he would have to leave the institution. 

Repatriation deals only with disabilities due to war service. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- Some totally and permanently incapacitated soldiers have not been eligible under the present act for treatment for any kind of illness. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  ."Why does not the honorable member submit the names of specific cases ? 

##### Sir CHARI ES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">PARKES, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- I have already done so. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  The Repatriation Commission accepts totally and permanently incapacitated cases. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- I am aware of that. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. 

##### Mr HOLT:<br><small class="text-muted">Fawkner</small>

.The amendment contains a good deal of merit, and I ask the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  to re-examine it. Soldiers returning to Australia during the first year after the cessation of hostilities will carry with them the aftereffects of many diseases which they contracted in the course of their war service, and presumably they will be entitled to medical treatment. I was not altogether satisfied with the reply given by the Minister for Health  **(Mr. Holloway)**  to the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  because it avoided the problem of illness not directly attributable to war causes. Whilst it might be difficult to establish that an illness occurring in the twelve months immediately following discharge was the direct result of war service, the conditions endured by the soldier probably rendered him more susceptible to even the common ailments that he contracted during that period. Any financial loss occasioned to the Administration in dealing with the odd cases that were not attributable to war service would be more than offset by the saving of the time of skilled men who would be engaged in sifting out the doubtful cases. Some men, after experiencing two consecutive summers, may then endure the rigours of a winter. That sudden change of climate will reduce their resistance . to even ordinary maladies. For that reason, as part of the general scheme of rehabilitation and to help to place returned men on a footing of equality with their fellow citizens, the Government might well accede to this request. It is not sufficient to say that the medical treatment does exist. It is fairly clear that it exists only in those cases which can be definitely shown to result from war service. 

##### Mr Holloway:

--  The honorable member will find if he looks up the history of the Repatriation Act that there was no trouble in the first twelve months after the last war, but trouble arose ten years later. 

##### Mr HOLT:

-- Then the concession will not cost the Government very much. 

##### Mr Barnard:

--  It is not a concession. 

##### Mr HOLT:

-- It is clear, from the reluctance of the Government to grant it, that it is a concession. It appears that a number of men will in the ordinary way incur illnesses which the Government believes will not be attributable to war service, or result from any particular weakening of their resistance, or their inability to re-adjust themselves to climatic or other conditions. Because the Government believes that there will be a number of such cases, which in its view should not reasonably be a charge on the repatriation administration, it resists the amendment. I cannot see the force of its attitude. 


 **Mr.** ABBOTT  (New England) [6.18 a.m. 1.- I support the amendment, and cannot understand why the Minister will not accept it. The most evident reason is that the Minister is in the deep slumber of a decided opinion, which he will not alter. The amendment is essential, not  only for the soldier, but also for the adequate, working of the department. When the men come back from the war many will probably begin in the first twelve months, when changing from war to peace life, to show signs of a breakdown, which may take place at some time in the future. This will enable the Minister and his department to make proper medical histories of the men in that early period, and to come to a decision, perhaps years afterwards, that the disability arose from war service. What the Minister for Health  **(Mr. Holloway)**  has said about the service being available now is ridiculous. The amendment can  do no harm, and may do an enormous amount of good. It will not cost the department much, and may save thousands of pounds by obtaining proper medical histories. The men may be saved and patched up and safeguarded against a breakdown by early medical treatment in the first twelve months after discharge. This matter might begin to operate within a few days, but a vast system of medical and hospital service for every body is not in operation yet, and is not likely to be for some time, according to the Treasurer  **(Mr.**  Chifley),  so that there will be a gap between the introduction of that service and the discharge of the soldiers', who may urgently need treatment in the next twelve months. 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:<br><small class="text-muted">Melbourne PortsMinister for Health &middot; ALP</small>

.Under the existing act and this bill, now and in the future, soldiers returning from war can get free medical treatment if they are sick or ailing owing to their war service. The amendment asks that free treatment be given to them even if the sickness is not due to war service. That power already exists, and all that the amendment does is to limit the time to twelve months, whereas at present there is no time limit. The amendment, therefore, does no good and may do harm. Another argument is that a medical examination may detect possible defects, and that it is wise to detect them as quickly as possible, but under the present act an X-ray is taken of every soldier on his discharge, so that the department already gets the foundation. 

##### Sir Charles Marr:

-- It did not after the last war. 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:

-- It does now, and will continue to do so, so that the department gets the initial history of the case and follows it up. 

##### Mr Spender:

-- If that is so, why object to the amendment? 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:

-- Because it is unnecessary. 

##### Mr BARNARD:<br><small class="text-muted">Bass</small>

.Either Opposition members are speaking in ignorance of the provisions of the act or  they are at cross purposes over the whole matter. I rose previously to make the point which the Minister for Health  **(Mr. Holloway)**  has now made. Many returned soldiers have come to me since I became a member, and I do not know of any who has not been able to get free treatment as the result of his illness. The amendment will not improve the present situation, but rather will limit the provision of medical treatment to a period of twelve months. It is now available to the men all the time, because I understand that they can always get free medical treatment. The amendment will not achieve anything, and may do a disservice to the soldiers. 

##### Mr MARWICK:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

.I support the amendment. Even to-day there are soldiers who are not getting free medical treatment. I had a case that lingered on with the Minister for the Army  **(Mr. Forde)**  for a long time. If the Minister were present he could confirm what I am about to say. The man had two days off to go to his brother's funeral, and while on leave had to be operated on. He went into a hospital, which was fortunately a military one, but he was operated on by a private doctor. I fought the case for six months, and even to-day returned men are not getting free medical treatment. 

##### Mr Barnard:

-- Look at the provisions of the act. 

##### The CHAIRMAN:

-- Order ! If the honorable member for Bass again interjects, I shall name him. 

##### Mr MARWICK:

-- The least that we can do is to give unconditionally, for a period of twelve months, free medical treatment to the men on their return, particularly as there is likely to be a high mortality rate among them. Even at the present time, men on leave are obliged to carry a quantity of quinine to guard against attacks of malaria. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

.- A strong case has been presented for free medical attention for returned soldiers. I should not, however, like the act to impose a time limit. The Minister has the power to bring down a regulation to deal with the matter. The returned soldiers' organizations are anxious that a' provision of this nature shall be made. Perhaps the proposed standing committee may investigate the subject. Is the Minister prepared to make a regulation? 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wentworth</small>

-- I am amazed at the " stone wall " of the Government. It seems reasonably certain that men discharged from the Army will have some disease latent in them, because of their services. If a man becomes ill, he may have to be treated by a general practitioner who is unable to diagnose an obscure tropical complaint. Because of his failure to obtain the advice of a specialist, the disease may develop rapidly, causing him to become a charge on the country. In the long run, the cost to the country would be greater than would be involved in free medical service for the short period during which the majority of the men would need it. I cannot understand why the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment. It would result in a considerable saving of man-power, repatriation benefits, pensions and general medical services. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- I cannot understand the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison).**  He was a member of a committee which went into this matter with the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  and myself, the result of which was that the Government agreed that a member totally and permanently incapacitated by reason of any complaint, should if necessary  be treated for twelve months. He was satisfied with that decision. There is not sufficient hospital accommodation to provide free medical treatment for all disabilities, whether war caused or not. The honorable member for Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr)**  continues to " harp " on malaria. I have had as much experience of that disease as he has, and know the effects of it and the measures which have to be taken to guard against it. Any member of the forces who has any disability, will be cared for. The whole of the repatriation system would be broken down, if the Government were to accept responsibility for everything that was not war caused. All that is possible will be done. The honorable members for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison),**  Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr)**  and Moreton  **(Mr. Francis),**  have been Ministers of the Crown, and must recognize that the Repatriation Department does everything possible for those who have war disabilities. We should not depart from the present rule. 

##### Sir Charles Marr:

-- Does the honorable gentleman agree with the Minister for Health that medical benefits are now available ? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- The Minister for Health had in mind men who returned sick. They will be well looked after. 

##### Sir Frederick Stewart:

-- Before discharge, not subsequently. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- After discharge, if they have war disabilities. Practically all our hospitals are filled at present. I cannot accept the amendment. It would not confer any benefit on the returned soldier, and every facility for treatment is now afforded. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

-- I am unable to support the amendment. The special committee discussed this matter at length and from several angles. The committee was impressed mostly by the fact that any soldier with a disability due to war service may promptly obtain medical attention. The honorable member for Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr)**  has stated repeatedly that appearance before a tribunal is necessary. That is not a fact. If a soldier who has been discharged contracts a disability due to his war service, he can seek advice from a medical practitioner appointed by the Repatriation Department, wherever he may be, and secure admittance immediately to a hospital. The committee should particularly bear in mind that, when the war is over our hospitals will be filled with very badly disabled soldiers. If men suffering from disabilities that are not due to war service are allowed to take up the available accommodation, bad and urgent cases which may need special treatment will not be able to obtain it in the hospitals. Those who have malaria can obtain automatic treatment. In a theatre of war in which malaria is likely to be contracted, the doctor will quickly detect it, and get the patient into hospital immediately. These were the reasons which prompted the special committee to reject the proposal. As a set-off, it decided to recommend that the Government should make additional provision for soldiers who areblinded, have tuberculosis, and are totally and permanently incapacitated. The Government accepted that proposition. 

Amendment negatived. 

Clause agreed to. 

Clause 41 - 

  >The First Schedule to the principal act is repealed and the following schedule inserted in its stead: - 


<graphic href="174331194303184_108_0.jpg"></graphic>


##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

.- I move - 

  >That, in the proposed new First Schedule, column 3, the item " £2 16s." be left out, as an instruction to the Government - 
  >
  >That the appropriate rates in the principal act should be increased in column 3 by at least 50 per cent. 

This matter is entirely different from that which the committee earlier determined, and is of considerable importance. The amendment which the Government proposes to effect to the schedule will have the result of placing on the one level of £5 a fortnight, the pensions payable to widows, on the death of members whose rates of pay ranged from 7s. to 18s. a day. That appears to be an unjust way of dealing with the matter. The injustice is aggravated among the higher ranks receiving 50s . a day. The widows of these men will receive £3 8s. a week, compared with the £2 10s. a week that is to be received by the widow of a soldier on the lowest rate of pay. I cannot find justification for that. Regard must be had to the fact that men who qualify for commissions are usually anxious to establish their families in suitable circumstances. The debate has disclosed the position in which a widow with children is placed on the death of her husband, compared with her position during his lifetime. The anomaly is aggravated tremendously in the higher commissioned ranks. I do not know why credit is not given to those who hold such  panics. Having regard to their official position, their widows should not be given a mere pittance. There must be greater disparity than is proposed between these persons and those who are on the basic rates. The widows of men who received between 7s. and 18a. a day are to be given £2 10s. a week, whilst the widows of officers of higher ranks are to receive only £3 8s. a week. I urge the Minister to recast' the schedule so as to give a larger amount, to the widows of men on the higher rates. There is every justification for an increase of the rates throughout the schedule by at least' 50 per cent. A pension of £3 8s. a week to the widow of the highest ranking officer is a shocking tribute to the service rendered by such men. 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Wakefield</small>

-- I expected the Minister to reply to the representations of the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender).**  I am completely in accord with what that honorable member has said. It is reasonable that men who, by their ability, rise to a high rank in the Army, should have extra pay, and that their widows should receive adequate compensation for the loss of income which they suffer by reason of the death of their husbands. It is all very well for the honorable member for Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr)**  to say that we are all in the war together, and should be all on the same level. The fact is that we have not accepted that principle. In practice, the general and his wife have to maintain a higher standard of living than have the private and hi? wife. That is no disgrace for the private; it is simply a fact. I am surprised that the Minister has not attempted to justify the proposal of the Government, seeing that the financial loss suffered by the widow of a general is so much greater than that suffered by that of a widow of a private. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

-- I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  with the greater pleasure because it was one of the recommendations of the special committee which the Government rejected. The committee recommended an increase of 20 per cent., but the Government proposes to make a flat increase of 8s. for all ranks. I am a democrat, but the fact remains that every one is not on the basic wage. I cite the instance of a distinguished naval officer who was required to maintain a home commensurate with his rank. He also had to pay insurance premiums, and to maintain his children at a boarding school. He made an allotment of £18 a week for the maintenance of his family.  'His  ship went down and he lost his life, and the income of his family dropped from £18 a week to between £3 and £4. Naval officers and professional soldiers, who devote all their energies to their profession, have little opportunity to build up an estate. Their normal expectation is that they will be able to support their family on their superannuation when they retire. I cannot understand why the recommendation of the committee should have been departed from, and I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- I cannot accept the amendment. It is strange that the only increase which the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  has pressed should be for the officers. 

##### Mr Francis:

--  That is utterly false, and is unworthy of the Minister. No one could have helped him more than I have done, and I have done it in the interest of the soldiers. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- There was not much difference after the last war in the rate of pensions payable to officers and private soldiers. The pension for a general was £3 a week, and that for a private £2 2s. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  The Minister knows that the widow of a naval officer who lost his life has been left in desperate circumstances. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- Yes, and I know that the same applied to the widows of many of the seamen who lost their lives at the same time. They also had to alter their way of living. 

##### Mr Francis:

--  It is only in this instance that the 20 per cent, increase was not applied. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- The Government decided upon a  flat rate, which was the most democratic thing it could do. ' 

Amendment negatived. 

Amendments (by  **Mr. Frost)**  agreed to- 

  >That, in the proposed new First Schedule, column 3, all the figures commencing with "2 1C 0" and ending with "4 18 0" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following figures : "  *\*  5 0 q ". 
  >
  >That the first paragraph to the footnote of the proposed now First Schedule be left out. 

##### Sir FREDERICK STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">Parramatta</small>

-- I move - 

  >That the following paragraph be added to the proposed new First Schedule: - " Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the rate of pension in the case of a widow and her children shall be, for the period commencing on the date of the commencement of the pension and ending on the date twelve months after the death of the member of the Forces, at a rate in the aggregate not less than the aggregate amount received by the widow in respect of herself and children by way of standard allotment and dependants' allowance immediately prior to the death of the member ". 

Many honorable members who found themselves unable to agree to a further general increase of the pensions rate expressed their readiness to support a proposal for increasing widows' pensions. These women have to adjust their way of living after the death of their husbands, and their only offence is that they have given their husbands to the service of their country. At present, the grim telegram announcing the death of a husband is followed very shortly by an almost equally grim communication announcing that, because of his death, the family income is to be considerably reduced. We cannot give the woman back her husband, but we ought at least to defer the second blow. In my amendment I am asking only that the diminution of income as between allotment and pension should not occur for a period of twelve months. There is a precedent for this in regard to what may be called civilian casualties. Widows who are not qualified under the general terms of the widows' pensions provision receive a compassionate grant for six months to enable them to adjust themselves to their new condition. In order to show the unfairness of the present proposal of the Government I cite the instance of the widow of a lieutenant. The man's allotment to his wife is £3 10s., but upon his death the widow would lose £1 a week. 

If she had one child her loss of income would amount to £1 8s. 6d. a week; with two children it would be £1 10s. a week; and with three children it would be £1 8s. a week. I maintain that some provision should be made to enable her to adjust herself to the altered situation. She would probably have to obtain a cheaper house, and make other suitable domestic arrangements. 

##### Mr Calwell:

--  How does the honorable member arrive at the figures which he has just cited? 


 **Sir FREDERICK** STEWART.They were supplied to me by the Commissioner for Repatriation. The variation of the amount of loss in respect of different numbers of children is due to the differential increases of children's allowances provided for in the bill. Unless the committee accepts an amendment of this kind, the widows of soldiers will have to live on their previous savings, while adjusting themselves to their greatly reduced incomes. I suggest to honorable members that this amendment at least will strongly appeal to their sympathetic impulses, and I ask the Minister to accept it without a division. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- The essential basis of the war pension scheme in Australia for both members of the forces and their dependants is a standard rate of pension in the .case of all ranks up to the rank of lieutenant. If the proposal of the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  were accepted, a drastic departure from this principle would result. In the case of a widow, with three children, of a soldier of the rank of private, she .would receive by way of pension under the amendment £5 ls. 6d. a week, whereas the widow and children of a lieutenant would receive £5 15s. 6d. a week. To pay war pensions at such differing rates would be quite opposed to the principle upon which the pension has been based in Australia since 1920. A departure from the principle in favour of one class would lead to pressure in the case of a member for pension to be paid for a period at the rate of his pay while serving as a member. The committee has already agreed to increase the pension of the first child of a widow from 12s. 6d. to 17s. 6d. a  week. In view of this fact, and the departure from the principle previously mentioned, the Government cannot accept the amendment. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- It is obvious and regrettable that, although we are living in a democracy, the repatriation officials are opposed to every amendment which honorable members submit. The department has prepared answers in opposition to every proposed amendment that has been circulated. The case presented by the honorable member for Parramatta should receive the strong support of the committee. The wife of a young man may have been in receipt of from £7 to £9 a week, but on the enlistment of her husband the income of the home is greatly reduced. If her husband suddenly died in action, the widow's income would immediately be further reduced by 30 per cent, or 40 per cent. Have we no sense of our responsibility and no desire to honour our promises to do what is fair to the  widows  of soldiers? I cannot understand the Government refusing to give way in the slightest degree. If any amendment has merit, surely that now under consideration has. When the wife of a soldier suddenly becomes a widow she needs some period in which to adjust herself to her weakened financial position, and all that is asked for by the honorable member for Parramatta is that for twelve months she shall not be placed in any worse position than when her husband was alive. I hope that the Minister will reject the advice of the repatriation officials, and support the important principle embodied in the amendment. Otherwise we shall witness a travesty of democracy. 

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Melbourne</small>

-- If acceptance of the amendment involves a departure from principle I am not appalled by the fact, and I think that the Minister might well give the amendment the reconsideration that it deserves. There is great merit in the proposal of the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart).**  I am not concerned about the social position of members of the forces, but I am concerned at the fact that when a woman loses her husband she has to expect almost immediately to have to meet a position in which her income is considerably diminished. Figures were quoted by the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  to show that a widow with three children is 14s. a week worse off than when her husband was still serving with the forces. 

##### Mr Francis:

-- Since I spoke the Government has given 5s. a week for each child, and the difference is now only 9s. a week. 

##### Mr CALWELL:

-- It seems reasonable to ask that the allotment shall continue for a period of twelve months. If the children are young the widow will have to provide for their education and arrange for accommodation for them, if she herself takes a position. Because of the sacrifice of the father we should not make it appear that we are anxious to finish, as quickly as possible, our financial obligations to the widow and her children in respect of the father's service. If the amendment be not accepted a similar proposal will be submitted in the Senate, and probably be agreed to. It will then be sent back to this committee, and we shall be asked to agree to it. In order to obviate the necessity to agree to an amendment by the Senate, we should recognize the intrinsic merit of the proposal now. If the honorable member for Parramatta had had more time to circulate his amendment, it might have received closer consideration at the hands of the Government, hut the fact that it has been hurriedly prepared does not justify its hasty rejection. We cannot do too much for the widows and children of the men who give their lives to keep this country free. 

This plea on behalf of soldiers' widows and their children should not fall on deaf ears. The former member for Melbourne,  **Dr. Maloney,**  was a noted advocate of the claims of women and children, and he would have warmly supported an amendment of this kind, regardless of the side of the chamber from which it emanated. The children of the nation are our living capital and we cannot do too much to help them. If there is lack of parental control to-day of children who have both parents to look after them, how serious will be the charge against us if we refuse the widow of a soldier increased financial support over a period of twelve months, to enable her to do a modicum of justice to her fatherless children. The sum of money involved does not amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds. The Repatriation Department is probably more concerned over the principle involved than the cost. We shall have introduced many new principles before the war is over, and the new order is established, and we should not be so conservative as to say that what was a principle of this act in 1920 must be a principle of it in 1943. 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wentworth</small>

-- I am amazed that the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  is not. prepared to accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart).**  The Minister is too big a man to have a little heart. He should let his head go, throw away the advice tendered to him by his hardhearted officials, tear up the notes they have given to him, and show bigness of heart. In order to prove the justice of the amendment, I shall compare the family income of " A ", a person drawing a 100 per cent, pension, before his death with the amount received by his widow after death. On the present scale the family income would be a minimum of £8 15s. a week, and on the proposed scale £9 13s., an improvement of 18s., but after his death it would drop to £4 5s. a week, a loss on the present scale of £5 10s., and on the proposed scale, £5 18s. It is anomalous that his widow loses more under the proposed rates than she does under the operating rates. The Minister cannot challenge the authenticity of these figures, which were supplied by officers of his own department who are well aware of the case. It is encumbent upon the Minister to get this matter into proper perspective, and to remove anomalies from the schedules contained in this hill. Compare the lot of the widow of a soldier who is killed or dies from injuries or disease sustained on active service with the widow of a man killed in a street accident in New South Wales. The widow of the civilian is awarded £800 as lump sum compensation plus £50 for two children plus £1 10s. a week Commonwealth widows' pension, plus £1 a week and 10s. a week for each child under the New South Wales 

Widows and Orphans Pensions Act. How niggardly are soldiers' widows treated in comparison with the way in which beneficent governments treat the civilians' widows. 

##### Sir Frederick Stewart:

-- The war widow does not qualify for a pension under the Widows' Pension Act. 

##### Mr HARRISON:

-- No. The other woman receives £800 of capital which she can invest in a small business, whereas on the death of her husband the war widow is plunged into penury. Maintenance of the military allotment paid to her during her husband's war service for twelve months after his death would enable the war widow to adjust herself to her new status. My plea, which is not in any way exaggerated, must touch the Minister's heart. It would cost the Treasurer little to comply with the proposal made by the honorable member for Parramatta. 

##### Mr COLES:<br><small class="text-muted">Henty</small>

.- I ask the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  to reconsider his answer to the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart),**  whose suggestion has more virtue than many others that have been made in this debate. The discussion has brought to light many anomalies, but that which the honorable member for Parramatta is seeking to remove is the worst. I do not think that the Minister's reply that to accept the amendment would infringe the flat rate on which pensions are based holds good. The shock that a woman suffers when she loses her husband should not be intensified by the additional shock of finding herself in sadly reduced circumstances as the result of her late husband's sacrifice of his life in the defence of his country. If we cannot ensure that a war widow shall continue to receive the amount which she received while her husband was on active service surely we can afford to ensure that for the twelve months following his death an amount equivalent to the allotment she received from his Army pay shall continue. If the Minister is adamant and a division is taken, my vote will be cast in support of the amendment. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">Parkes</small>

-- I welcome the support of the honorable member for Melbourne  **(Mr. Calwell)**  and the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles)**  to the reasonable proposal which has been made by the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  . The plight of a war widow deprived of the money that she was receiving- when her husband was an active defender of this country was mentioned during the debate on the second reading. Several honorable members presented strong arguments in support of the Government maintaining a war widow on the same financial basis that she was on when her husband was still soldiering. The Government has agreed to pay child endowment for the first child of all such widows. Therefore, instead of losing 14s. a week, she will now lose 9s. The Treasury would, as every one must agree, suffer little loss if all war widows were allowed to retain the £23 8s. a year which it is now proposed that they shall lose. My main concern is the widows on the bread line. Recently I was visited in my office in Sydney by the widow of a sailor about whose death she did not learn until she read it in the casualty list in a newspaper. She met her husband in England and married him there, and she told me that she had no friends in this country. The income of that woman who has three children drops from £5 to £3 19s. a week. I give the Government good marks for this bill, but I would give it a credit if it would yield on this matter. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

-- In my second-reading speech, I said that the recommendation of the special committee on pensions for widows and orphans had not achieved what the members of the committee aimed at. I pointed out that a widow of a soldier killed on active service overseas lost 14s. a week as the result of his death. The Minister has gone a part of the way towards removing that anomaly by agreeing to extend child endowment to the first child of such a widow. That, however, stil] leaves the widow at a disadvantage of 9s. a week as compared with her financial condition when her husband was a member of the forces. I think that after pondering this matter at the breakfast table the Minister will come back to the chamber and announce that the proposal of the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  is worthy, and that it will be accepted. All I ask is that for twelve months after the death of her husband a war widow be paid by the Government the allotment which her husband made to her while he was alive in order that she may be enabled to readjust herself to her altered circumstances. 

##### Sir Frederick Stewart:

--  The widow of a private soldier with two children loses lis. a week on the death of her husband. _  **Mr. FRANCIS.-**  Yes, but the dissections have been in respect of families in which there are three children. I dispute the suggestion that all the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  does- when he answers honorable member's suggestions is to read a statement prepared for him by officials of the Repatriation Department. The Minister should not look to officials for decisions-. He makes the decisions, with the approval of his colleagues in the Ministry and asks the officials of the Repatriation Department for the data to support them. What the Minister does is acquaint his officers of his decision and ask them to provide him with a detailed reply setting out the grounds of objection. The Minister is entitled to obtain from departmental officers whatever information is necessary to enable him to place before honorable members his view of the case. 


 *Sitting suspended from 7.30 to 9.80 a.m.* 


##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- The proposal before the committee is that a married woman who loses her husband on war service shall continue to receive for a period of twelve months the rate of service pay to which she was entitled while her husband was alive. The principle has been adopted from the Widows' Pensions Act, under which a widow who cannot quite qualify for a pension is granted a gratuity for six months in order to enable her to adjust herself to the altered standard of living made necessary by the death of her husband. In my opinion, that is one of the best features of the pensions system. I appreciate the action of the Government in yielding to representations made by myself and other honorable members on both sides to grant 5s. a week for the first child. Our discussions have been based on &gt;a widow with three children, in respect of two of -whom she receives child endowment. The amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta would improve the bill substantially, and assist a woman greatly in the time of her greatest need. Under the bill as drafted, a woman with three children whose husband is serving with the forces would receive 14s. a week less after the death of her husband than when he was alive. The concession to which I have just referred reduces that difference by 5s. a week, but she will have an income of 9s. a week less than before the loss of her husband. A payment of an addiditional 9s. a week for twelve months would amount to only about £23 a member. At an earlier hour I asked the Minister to consider the amendment during the suspension of the sitting for breakfast, and I hope that he is now in a position to say that he will accept it. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

-- I cannot add anything to what has been said, except ]to urge the Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  to give to the amendment his favorable consideration. I believe that it would improve the bill, and I intend to vote for it. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">New England</small>

-- I, too, shall support the amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart).**  When a man is killed on active service the change in the family life comes more suddenly than after the death of the bread7winner in civil life, following a long illness. In the latter instance the* family has some time in which to adjust itself to the changed circumstances, but in the event of the death of a serviceman that change is sudden. The result is that in the moment of her greatest sorrow the widow has to face great financial difficulties. I ask the Minister to view the amendment favorably; but, should he not see his way to accept it now, I suggest that he refer it hack to the special committee for investigation and report. 

##### Mr POLLARD:<br><small class="text-muted">Ballarat</small>

-- I think that the amendment is reasonable, and might well be favorably considered by the Minister  **(Mr. Frost).**  Any woman who loses her husband on active service is entitled to our deepest sympathy; but, should she have young children to care for, her position is most difficult, notwithstanding  the various benefits she may receive under the repatriation legislation passed by this Parliament. I ask the Minister to accept  the  amendment. Not a great deal of money is involved. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- I hope that the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  will not press his amendment. I am impressed by  the  suggestion of the honorable member  for  New England  **(Mr. Abbott)**  that this matter be referred back to the special committee which previously submitted a report to the Government. This matter was raised some time ago and I brought it before the committee, which agreed  to  abolish the means test for widows. Later the Government agreed .to make an allowance of 5s. for the first child of a family, in respect of whom no child endowment is paid. I have no desire to be hard on widows, but I think that the concessions already made are considerable. They do much to bridge the gap that previously existed between the amount payable  to  the wife of a soldier before and after she becomes a widow. I trust that  the  committee will accept the clause in its present form. I should like to accede to the wishes of honorable members, but I cannot see my way to do so. 

##### Sir FREDERICK STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">Parramatta</small>

-- I cannot agree  to  the suggestion of the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  that I should withdraw my amendment in order that the proposal embodied in it may be referred to the special committee for investigation. Six months have already elapsed since the report on which the  bill  is based was presented to the Government. In the meantime, many widows of soldiers have lost the benefits which would have accrued to them had there  been no delay. Several more months are likely to elapse before the 

Parliament meets again after the termination of the present sittings. He would be a bold prophet indeed who would prophesy what will happen in the political sphere within the next few months. Every week men are losing their lives in the battle line, and we have no right to defer this matter. The Minister's statement that the financial position of the widow will be improved by the granting of 5s. a week in respect of the first child of a family has no significance. We are not asking for this payment in perpetuity, but merely for a time sufficient to enable a woman who has lost her husband in the country's service to adjust her economic conditions to her new circumstances. For the information of honorable members who were not here when this proposal was submitted to the committee, I repeat that the wife of a private soldier with one child receives by way of standard allotment and dependant's allowances £3 17s. a week while her husband is alive, but after his death that amount, after allowing for the concession of os., which has since been made in respect of the first child, will fall to £3 7s. 6d., a reduction of 9s. 6d. a week. In similar cases a widow with two children will have her allowances reduced from £5 5s. to £4 a week. These are substantia] reductions, which should not be imposed on a woman immediately following her bereavement. The committee would be recreant to its trust if it did not press the amendment. 

##### Mr MARTENS:<br><small class="text-muted">Herbert</small>

-- I suggest that instead of the undertaking which he has already given, the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  should give an undertaking that the special committee which submitted recommendations on which this bill is based be consulted before the measure reaches the Senate. The proposal embodied in the amendment is a proper one, and, as no great sum is involved, I thought that the Minister would accept it. He has not done so, but I trust that he will accede to my suggestion and place the proposal before the committee in time for its recommendations to be considered by the Senate when the bill reaches that chamber. 

##### Mr SPOONER:<br><small class="text-muted">Robertson</small>

-- I am glad that the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  does not propose to withdraw his amendment. It is not only fair, but also is urgently required. The proposal cornea within a different category from those matters which were discussed at earlier stages of the bill. In the first place, the benefit to the widow will not be permanent; it will continue for only twelve months. It is different from an adjustment of a pension ' which may continue for many years. The proposal is to pay to the widow a sum which will tide her over a most critical period. This is not a matter upon which the all-party committee can give us any great assistance. All that is involved is a plain question of fact, whilst the extra cost is small in relation to the total pension. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. It falls within an entirely different category from the other amendments which have been proposed, most of which involve questions of principle, and difficult calculations. This provision is to operate for only twelve months after the death of the soldier; but it is within that period that the widow requires all the assistance that can be given to her. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

.The amendment provides only a temporary benefit. The benefit will operate for twelve months after the death of the soldier. That means that the total liability under the amendment in respect of all claimants will cease twelve months after the end of the war. The amount involved is not very great. The Government, under its national welfare scheme, intends to allocate £30,000,000 annually to a fund to finance that scheme; but the main features of the scheme cannot be implemented while the war lasts. In view of the comparatively small sum that would be required to meet the extra benefits proposed under the amendment, the Government should seriously consider the proposal.' The benefit proposed is in keeping with the basic principles of the Government's National Welfare Scheme. The submission of this amendment shows that it would have been very desirable for the special committee to have given to honorable members an opportunity to give evidence individually before it in order to put forward suggestions of this kind. Honorable members on this side, at any rate, have not had an opportunity to discuss this matter. Obviously, however, the proposal is justified; and, in all the circumstances, the Government should give it favorable consideration. 

##### Mr JOLLY:<br><small class="text-muted">Lilley</small>

.- I support the amendment moved by the honorable' member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart).**  I do so rather for humane reasons and not so much because the amount of expenditure involved is comparatively small. It is hard to imagine that we shall be content to notify the widow of the death of the soldier, and, at about the same time, notify her of a reduction of the amount of her allotment. "We must remember that the receipt of news of his death is the hour of the widow's greatest sorrow7. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- I hope that even at this eleventh hour the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  will relent, and yield to the views which have been expressed by honorable members on both sides in support of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart).**  ' I regard the amendment as one of the most meritorious yet proposed in this debate. The extra benefit which it is proposed to give will be all the more appreciated by the widow because it will be made available to her at a time of real hardship. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- I should like to postpone further consideration of this clause to a later hour, in order that I may look more fully into the amendment. 

Clause, as amended, and amendment postponed -  *by leave*  - until after consideration of proposed new clauses. 

Clause 42 (Amendment of the Second Schedule). 

##### Sir EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

-- I again raise the point which I dealt with in my second-reading speech, when I pointed out that the limitation of the period in hospital to six weeks for which a pensioner is entitled to the full rate of pension was operating detrimentally to the interests of the pensioner and the community. I understood that the Minister for Repatriation (Mi. 

Frost) was inclined to agree with that view. Perhaps the amendment which I advocate in respect of this clause can be effected by regulation. Previously I raised this matter particularly with respect to pensioners suffering from tuberculosis, but I should like also to apply my proposal to pensioners who are permanently and totally incapacitated as the result of other ailments or injuries. I know from my own personal experience, which has been confirmed in discussions which I have had with other doctors, that many pensioners leave hospital at the end of the period of six weeks with a view to re-entering hospital later in order again to qualify for the full rate of pension. In respect of serious amputations or serious injuries to the' limbs, for instance, such pensioners leave hospital when a few weeks longer in the institution would benefit them substantially. In that way pensioners act to their own detriment, and their only reason for doing so is in order that they can again qualify for the full rate by re-entering hospital. The extra cost involved by completely abolishing this time limitation would not be very great. In any case it would practically be offset by the reduction of hospital expenses in the treatment of pensioners for longer but fewer periods. 

Clause agreed to. 

Clause 43 - 

  >The Thi rd Schedule to the Principal Act is repealed and the following Schedule inserted in its stead: - 


<graphic href="174331194303184_116_2.jpg"></graphic>


Amendment (by  **Mr. Frost)**  proposed - 

  >That in the proposed new Third Schedule the words "children of a member" down to "25s. per fortnight", inclusive, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words: - 


<graphic href="174331194303184_117_0.jpg"></graphic>


##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- It seems that the representations which have been made from this side of the chamber, particularly by honorable members from New South Wales, have borne fruit at least in respect of the children of a deceased soldier. I ask the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  whether he can give a minimum flat rate of 15s. a week for all children. In an amendment to this clause, of which I have given notice, I propose a minimum flat rate of 30s. a fortnight in respect of all children other than the first child in the case of death of a member of the forces, and also in the case of total incapacity of a member of the forces. 

Amendment agreed to. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- I move - 

  >That in the proposed new Third Schedule the words " each child of a member . . . 18s. per fortnight ", be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words: - " each child of a member . . . 30s. per fortnight ". 

##### Sir Charles Marr:

--  . Since that amendment was forecast by the honorable member for Warringah, I think that the Government agreed to increase the allowance in respect of the first child of any member by 5s. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  Yes; and that was in order to offset the non-payment of child payment in respect to the first child. 

##### Mr Jolly:

--  The honorable member for Warringah is proposing to increase the allowance only in respect of children other than the first child, in the case of death of a member of the forces, and in the case of total incapacity of a member of the forces. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- That is so. The other cases are now covered to my satisfaction. 

Amendment negatived. 

Clause, as amended, agreed to. 

Clauses 44 and 45 agreed to. 

Clause 46 - 

  >The sections of the Principal Act, as amended by the foregoing provisions of this Act, which are specified in the first column of the Second Schedule to this Act arc amended as respectively specified opposite thereto in the second column of that Schedule. 

Amendment (by  **Mr. Frost)**  agreed to- 

  >That after the word " Act ", second occurring, the following words be inserted: - " (other than the provisions of the last preceding section) ". 

Clause, as amended, agreed to. 

New clause 13a. 

##### Mr BECK:<br><small class="text-muted">Denison</small>

.- I move - 

  >That, after clause 13, the following new clause be inserted: - "13a. Section twenty-two of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in the definition of 'Dependants' the following further proviso :  - 
  >
  > Provided further that any such wife married to a member of the Forces while the member - 

{: type="a" start="a"}
0. was in receipt of a pension under the 

Second Schedule to this Act or would, but for the third paragraph of that Schedule, have been in receipt of such a pension; or 

{: type="a" start="b"}
0. was in receipt of an amountin respect of a disability described in any of the first eight items in the first column of the Fifth Schedule to this Act orwould, but for subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of the proviso to that Schedule, have been in receipt of such an amount, shall be deemed to be a dependant;'.". 

In accordance with an amendment made to the Repatriation Act of 1938, pensions are not payable to wives of members of the 1st Australian Imperial Force who have married an ex-member of that force since that date. This amendment is aimed at making wives of seriously disabled soldiers, including blinded soldiers, totally and permanently incapacitated soldiers and soldiers suffering from tuberculosis, who have married since 1938, eligible for a pension. As the act stands, should a soldier who is absolutely dependent upon his wife have the misfortune to lose her, her pension dies with her, and should he remarry, no pension is payable in respect of his second wife. In that way he is penalized seriously. He may have to employ a housekeeper or some one to look after him, and to pay for such assistance out of his pension. Such a state of affairs is not in the interests of the soldier or of the public. The amendment includes also cases specified in the first eight lines of the Fifth Schedule, namely, double amputation cases. I should like to have gone much farther, as I indicated in my secondreading speech, and included wives of all disabled soldiers whether they be amputation cases or disability cases. However, the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  indicated that the adoption of my suggestions in their entirety would involve considerable cost, and although I agree that that would be so, these other cases are fully entitled to consideration. I trust that the Minister will see his way clear to accept the amendment. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- This matter has already been placed before me by a deputation representing blinded and totally and permanently incapacitated . soldiers. I agree that such a soldier who loses his wife suffers a great disability. The deputation stated the case very clearly and I promised to look into the matter. It may be that if the Government were to lift the restriction on the payment of pensions in respect of wives married to members of the 1st Australian Imperial Force since 1938, the entire basis of the scheme might be upset. However, it may be possible to overcome the difficulty by making a compassionate allowance. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  Would that include the wives of soldiers suffering from tuberculosis? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- I would not say that. If a soldier were suffering from that disease, discretion would rest with the Repatriation Commission. 

##### Mr BECK:<br><small class="text-muted">Denison</small>

.- In view of the assurance given by the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  that this matter will be dealt with by making allowances to wives in these cases, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. 

New clause -  *by leave*  - withdrawn. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

-- I move - 

  >That, after clause 13, the following new clause he inserted: - " 13a. Section twenty -two of the Principal Act is amended by adding to the definition of ' Permanently unemployable ' the words ' in which, in the opinion of the Commission, he can reasonably be expected to obtain regular employment'.". 

When service pensions were introduced into the Repatriation Act in 1935, it will be recalled that one of the alternative' conditions to obtaining a service pension, was that an applicant should be permanently unemployable. A definition of permanently unemployable was then inserted in section 22 of the act, in the following terms : - 

  >Permanently unemployable means permanently incapable by reason of physical and mental disablement of being employed in a remunerative occupation. 

As that definition stands, a man may be deemed to be capable of being employed in a remunerative occupation, although he has no reasonable chance of being so employed. I am asking the committee to -apply to this  legislation the same principle that was laid down in the interpretation of the New South Wales Compensation Act in the case of  *Wicks*  v.  *The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited.*  In that case, a man who had been engaged on manual work all his life sustained an injury to a leg which prevented him from standing on it for more than a few minutes, but the medical report said that he was capable of sedentary work. The case ultimately reached the High Court which decided as follows : - 

  >The commission was, therefore,' called upon to decide whether the worker had been permanently and totally disabled, an expression which, in our opinion, means physically incapacitated from ever earning by work any part of his livelihood. This condition is satisfied when capacity for earning has gone except for the chance of obtaining special employment of an unusual kind. 

In connexion with service pensions, as is the case with invalid and old-age pensions, the authorities tend to hold that if an applicant is capable of performing some class of remunerative work, be is not permanently unemployable within the meaning of the definition, although the getting of such work is only remotely possible. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  Or although the man may be- completely untrained for such work. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- Yes. The honorable member for .Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  will recall the well-known reference to an " odd lot " - 

  >They have reserved the term " odd lot " for a man so injured that he is only able to do certain very special jobs depending on finding a very special employer who, either from compassion or because he has a special job, is able to give him employment, but any ordinary class of work he is not able to do. 

In my view, if a person is not able to earn his living by performing ordinary work he should be regarded as being permanently unemployable. An applicant should not be excluded merely because he is able to obtain casual work of a particular kind. For that reason I have inserted in my proposed new clause the words " can reasonably be expected to obtain regular employment ". 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- The definition of " permanently unemployable " was given much consideration at the time the service pension provisions were introduced, as it was realized that the pension was of a special nature, and should be granted only to men who, for all practical purposes, were permanently unemployable, and was really in the nature of an invalid pension. In addition, however, provision was made for the wife and children to receive also service pensions. To amend the definition " permanently unemployable " on the lines indicated by the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  would be a distinct departure from the intention and would alter the whole aspect of the pension. Moreover, it is difficult to interpret the meaning of the amendment as it certainly seems to be a contradiction of the first part of the definition, and will have the effect of reducing the pension to something in the nature of an ordinary unemployment benefit. I can assure honorable members that the provision is most sympathetically administered by the commission, and in support of this I quote from instructions issued by the commission for the guidance of its medical officers - 

  >To determine whether a member of the forces is, for the purpose of his application under section 45ab " permanently unemployable ", the commission realizes is a matter in the first instance for the expression of opinion of a medical officer having regard to a man's physical and mental condition, including all the disabilities attributable to or not attributable to war service. The commission feels that it can safely be left to the discretion of medical officers to form an opinion and make a recommendation to the board, after examination of the applicant. No more difficulty should be experienced in determining whether a man is " permanently unemployable " than there has been in the past to determine whether a man is "totally and permanently incapacitated the only difference in the case of applicants for service pensions being that they need not necessarily be totally incapacitated. The medical officer should form his opinion on the facts at the time of examination, and if there is a doubt in his mind, he may recommend a review of the man's condition in two, three or five years as the case may demand. 

I think that honorable members will agree that this is a most generous interpretation of the existing definition, and it will be noted that this is another instance where the benefit of the doubt is conceded. I am, therefore, opposed to the proposed new clause as the matter is so involved and has. such far-reaching consequences, that I consider it unreasonable to ask this committee to amend- the provision without the fullest consideration of the matter from every possible viewpoint. I think that it would be more appropriate to refer the question to the proposed Repatriation Committee as a most suitable subject for its consideration, and I will undertake to see that this is done. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

-- I am not satisfied with the statement of the Minister  **(Mr. Frost).**  The proposed new clause which I submitted has been printed and circulated for some time, and the honorable gentleman had ample opportunity to consider it. As I see no prospect of an early decision if the proposal is referred to the proposed Repatriation Committee, I ask honorable members to agree to it now. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- No danger will arise if the Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  accepts the proposed new clause, because the decision will now rest with the Repatriation Commission. At present, the definition is too rigid. No provision is made for the Repatriation Commission to use its discretion in determining the matter, and the person who is known as an " odd lot " is just as permanently unemployable as the person defined in the proposed new clause. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  There are always " border-line " eases. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- That is why I suggest that protection to the Government and the Repatriation Commission is afforded by the fact that the matter will rest with the commission for decision. With that " brake " introduced into the definition, there is no danger, and the provision will be sufficiently elastic to cover the " border-line " case. 

##### Mr Beasley:

--  What is the honorable member's interpretation of " regular employment " ? 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- That which is regular, and not casual. . 

##### Mr Beasley:

--  A casual job may be a regular job. 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-Not in the sense in which I use the word. There must be the element of regularity as distinct from casual work undertaken here and there. The " brake " which has been introduced into the definition is sufficient to make it acceptable. I support the proposed new clause. 

##### Sir FREDERICK STEWART:<br><small class="text-muted">Parramatta</small>

-- Every Minister for Social Services who has administered the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act has been irked from time to time by the rigidity of the interpretation of the words " totally and permanently incapacitated ", which is the qualification necessary to secure an invalid pension. I join with the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  and the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  in urging the Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  to accept the proposed new clause, remembering that the ultimate discretion in the matter will rest with the Repatriation Commission. On many occasions I wished that my powers to deal with these cases could have been a little more elastic than they were. A person, who had lost his limbs, may be told that he can still carry on in a sedentary occupation. That implies clerical work, but the applicant for the pension may have no knowledge of such work. 

##### Mr Pollard:

--  A miner might be told to take a course in accountancy. 


 **Sir FREDERICK** STEWART.Yes. I should like to hear the opinion of the Minister upon this matter. As a private member, he expressed definite views on the subject. I am confident that, if he were to speak his mind freely this morning, he would express even more emphatically and effectively than I did the opinion that the proposed new clause is justified. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">New England</small>

-- I support the proposal, because it appeals to every honorable member who represents a rural constituency. Repeatedly, we encounter sad cases of hardship. Men who might be able to obtain employment in some capacity in a large city have no chance of getting a job in the small town or village in which they live. While they reside in those districts they are totally and permanently incapacitated, and they have no money or means to enable them to travel to the city in search of employment. In the name of humanity, I ask the Minister to accept the proposed new clause. 

##### Sir EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

-- For seven years I administered the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and I considered that one of the mostvaluable authorities possessed by the responsible Minister was the opportunity to grant, in special circumstances, a compassionate pension. That opportunity was availed of only in extraordinary circumstances. The Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  should have a similar authority for the purpose of enabling him to grant a compassionate pension. Many men are not regarded, by medical standards, as being totally and permanently incapacitated; but, because of physical defects, lack of training, or the locality in which they are forced to live, they are unable to earn any money. The Repatriation Commission should have a discretionary power to deal with those cases, and such a provision would enormously improve the administration of the act. I support the proposed new clause. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

.The present definition is too rigid, and fetters the hands of the Repatriation Commission. The proposal provides elasticity and allows the commission some discretion in making a decision. The matter is very simple, and can be decided immediately. There is no necessity to refer it to the proposed repatriation committee. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">Parkes</small>

-- I fail to see why the proposal is not acceptable to the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost).**  "I agree with the right honorable member for Cowper  **(Sir Earle Page)**  that the discretionary power should be conferred on the Repatriation Commission, which is responsible for granting or refusing this assistance. The proposed new clause, if adopted, will not involve a substantial increase of expenditure. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  I am not thinking of the increase of expenditure. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- The rigidity of the act at present results in hardship ; but the difficulty can be overcome by granting to the commission power, in special circumstances, to make a compassionate payment to a man whose condition of health prevents him from earning any money. 

##### Mr COLES:<br><small class="text-muted">Henty</small>

.- I support the proposed new clause and ask the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  to give the fullest consideration to it. The value of granting some discretion to the Repatriation Commission at this point is that it will save a good deal of acute distress in the community. The difference between the full pension of £2 10s. and the pension payable to a totally and permanently incapacitated person is substantial. This class of case constantly arises, but tribunals cannot deal with them. The applicant cannot prove that he is unable to work, although he has no chance of obtaining permanent or regular employment. The Minister should not dismiss the proposal lightly. If adopted, it will facilitate the administration of the act. No danger can arise from showing leniency in this instance. 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">North Sydney</small>

-- I regard the proposition sympathetically. I do not know whether the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  sought to draw a distinction between the class of person to whom he referred, and service pensioners. 

##### Mr Blackburn:

--  These are service pensioners. . 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- The honorable member will recollect the comprehensive discussion that took place when a previous government introduced legislation to amend the act. The measure, which was long overdue, conferred great benefits on a long-neglected section of the community. I should like to know whether the persons whom the honorable member has in mind are, or are not, included in the class eligible to receive the service pension. 

##### Sir Frederick Stewart:

--  This class has been refused the service pension. 

##### Mr HUGHES:

--  I am sure that a permanently unemployable person, other things being equal, is eligible to receive the service pension. The Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  should give to this matter his close, immediate and sympathetic consideration. In the modern world, it is very easy for a person to become permanently unemployable. If he does not fit into a niche, there is no place for him. If a person lacks the physical strength to enable him to fight for recognition, he must become a specialist, and rely upon skill and alertness to win a place for him. This class of totally and permanently incapacitated person is most deserving, and should be eligible to receive the service pension. If the Minister has considered differentiating between the various classes of persons who are now entitled to receive the service pension, perhaps he will be good enough to study the class to whom the honorable member for Bourke referred. I support the proposed new clause. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- After hearing the views expressed by honorable members on both sides of the chamber, I feel that I can do no less than agree to their representations. 

New clause agreed to. 

New clause 14a. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

-- I move - 

  >That, after clause 14, the following new clause be inserted: - " 14a. After section twenty-three of the Principal Act the following section is inserted: - 23a. - (1.) No deduction shall be made from the degree of actual disability of any member of the Forces who has served in a theatre of actual war on account of any disability or disabling condition which existed in him at the time at which he became a member of the Forces; but no pension shall be paid for a disability or disabling condition which at such time was wilfully concealed, was obvious, was not of a nature to cause rejection from service, or was a congenital defect.  (2.) An applicant shall not be denied a pension in respect of disability resulting from injury or disease or the aggravation thereof incurred during military service or in respect of the death of a' member of the Forces resulting from such injury or disease or the aggravation thereof solely on the ground that no substantial disability or disabling condition is considered to have existed at the time of discharge of such member of the Forces 

I have had the opportunity of discussing sub-section 1 of proposed new section 23a with the representatives of the Repatriation Department. It relates to preenlistment disabilities. Sub-section 2 of section 23 of the act, although it has been slightly altered by an amendment moved in committee by the right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes),**  can, for the purposes of my argument, be quoted as it appears in the original act, as follows :  - 

  >Notwithstanding that the origin of the cause of the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces, who, after enlistment with those forces, served in camp in Australia for at least six months or embarked for active service with those forces overseas, existed prior to his enlistment, where, in the opinion of a board - 

{: type="a" start="a"}
0. the conditions of his war service contributed to any material degree to the death or incapacity of the member ; and 
1. neither the death or incapacity, nor the origin of the cause of the death or incapacity, was due to the default or wilful act of the member, the Commonwealth shall, subject to this act, be liable to pay to the member or his dependants, or both, as the case may be, pensions in accordance with this division. 

The proposed new sub-section 1 was prepared for the purpose of providing that no deduction shall be made from the degree of actual disability of any member of the forces who has served in a theatre of actual war, on account of any disability or disabling condition which existed in him at the time at which he became a member of the forces, with a proviso that no pension shall be paid for a disability which at the time was wilfully concealed, and so on. I am told by the Repatriation Department that, although on my reading of sub-section 2 of section 23 of the act there would be no obligation to pay the pension in full, the department does not make any deduction for any disability that comes within the section. That' meets my objection, and makes sub-section 1 of proposed new section 23a unnecessary. Sub-section 2 of my proposed new section 23a deals with the case in which a man is discharged from the forces with no substantial disability, and later becomes disabled through injury or disease, or their aggravation, incurred during military service, or dies as a consequence of such injury or disease. It would prevent the commission from taking advantage of the fact that no substantial disability was considered to have existed at the time of discharge, in determining whether a pension should be granted. Again I am informed by the Repatriation Commission that, in actual practice and administration, both those aspects are covered. I accept that assurance, and in the circumstances I ask leave to withdraw my motion-. 

New clause -  *by leave*  - withdrawn. 

New clause 17a. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

-- I move - 

  >That, after clause 17, the following new clause be inserted: - " 17a. Section thirty-one  a  of the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section: -  (3.) Where a member of the Forces - 
  >
  >at any time after his discharge from the Forces, became or becomes incapacitated, or died or dies, from pulmonary tuberculosis, and pension in respect of the incapacity or death would not, but for this sub-section, be payable, the Commonwealth shall, subject to this Act and upon receipt of an application in writing, be liable to pay to the member or his dependants, or both, as the case may be, from the date of the application, pension in accordance with Division 1 of this Part as if the incapacity or death resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces'.". 

##### Mr Frost:

--  I told the honorable member that I would be agreeable to accept the proposal. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- My reasons for proposing it are these: A tubercular soldier who has not had his complaint accepted by the Repatriation Commission as due to war service, is granted a service pension of £1 18s. 6d. a week. He receives treatment when necessary in a repatriation hospital or sanatorium, at a cost to the Repatriation Department of £4 3a. a week in New South Wales, and up to £5 lis. a week in other States. If he were given a full pension for tuberculosis due to war service, it would cost the Government only £2 ls. 6d. a week more to make up the service pension to a full pension, instead of the sanatorium cost of from £4 3s. to £5 lis.  a  week for his treatment in an institution, in addition to the service pension of £1 18s. 6d. The granting to all tuberculosis sufferers of a full pension would, therefore, effect a considerable saving to the Repatriation Department. I understand that the Minister intends to adopt the proposed new clause, and I appreciate his ready acceptance of the representations made by me to him in this matter. I believe that it will do great service and bring about a large measure of relief to a section of our community, the members of which have been the greatest sufferers from war disabilities. By this clause they move up to the full pension. 

##### Mr CONELAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Griffith</small>

-- I am pleased to know that the Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  has agreed to grant the full pension to sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis who have served in a theatre of war. They deserve every consideration, and I have done everything in my power to help them. As I have pointed out, in common with other honorable members, the cost involved will not be very great. I am pleased that after 25 years this Government has the credit of bringing in a comprehensive repatriation bill, including this very much needed reform. I congratulate the Government on all that it has done. 

##### Sir EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

-- A supplement to this clause is really the question of the continuous payment of the pension while the patient is in hospital. I raised the matter at the time on the appropriate clause, but, owing to some misunderstanding or confusion, the necessary amendment was not made in clause 42. When the bill is reported from committee, I ask the Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  to recommit it, in order to enable a consequential amendment to be made, so as to allow the full intention of the Government and the committee to be carried into effect. 

New clause agreed to. New clause 17b. 


 **Mr.** SPENDER  (Warringah) [10.40 a.m. j. - I move - 

  >That, after new clause 17a, the following now clause be inserted: - " 17b. After section thirty-one  a  of .the Principal Act the following section is inserted : -  31ab. - (1.) The Commission may, on special application in that behalf, grant a compassionate pension or allowance in any case which it considers to be specially meritorious, but in which the Commission, or, on an appeal, a Tribunal, lias decided that the applicant is otherwise unqualified to receive such an award under this Act.  (2.) The amount of any compassionate pension or allowance granted under this section shall be such sum as the Commission shall fix, but not exceeding the amount to which the applicant would have been entitled if h is entire chum to payment had been upheld.'.". 

I submit that provision because one finds, from time to time, many cases which do not come within the ambit of the act, but in which I am quite certain that, if the commission were invested with this power, ii would be only too ready to see that the applicant got some assistance. Most honorable members know that such cases can arise under SeCTion 15au. which provides that, where the incapacity or death of a member is not due to his default or wilful act, or does not arise from intentionally self-inflicted injuries, or from any breach of discipline by him, a pension will be granted, but where it is so due a pension will not be granted. There are cases which to my knowledge have arisen from time to time which would justin the granting to the commission of t* compassionate power which I propose in the proposed new section. I hope that the Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  will accept it, because it is intended to deal with hard cases, where there are especially meritorious circumstances, but where, because the member does not come within the strict ambit of the act, the applicant is denied relief. 

##### Mr Brennan:

--  Who has the discretion under the honorable member's proposal ? 

##### Mr SPENDER:

-- The commission. I think that in practice the whole matter would come within a very small compass, and the Minister could very readily accept it. I know that his repatriation officials are against it, because they anticipate that there will be a large number of claims for compassionate grants, but I put it to the Ministerthat that argument should be rejected. In seeking to do justice by allowing such a compassionate pension where the commission thinks that there are circumstances which merit it, one should not be frightened by the proposition that too many applications will be made to the commission. The commission itself, by the way in which it handles the matter, will be its own brake on the number of applications likely to be made, but I suggest that there should be this safeguard in the act in order to cover cases which are otherwise meritorious, but which fail to comply with its strict provisions. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- As the honorable member forWarringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  said, this is a very important matter. If the proposed new clause were agreed to, it would practically lead to another pension being granted. Those who fail to obtain a pension would apply for a compassionate allowance, and I do not know where the commissioner could stop. This matter was referred to in my second-reading speech, and it was thought that the Government had given sound reasons for not introducing such a system in the act, the basic principle of which must be a war pension, payable in respect of war-caused incapacity. The introduction of a compassionate grant system such as the honorable member for Warringah asks for, would lead to no end of confusion and odious comparisons between the value of the services of one man and another. The Government believes that all its fighting men are worthy of equal consideration, and does not consider that it is the desire of Australian people that special treatment should be given to those who have merited special recognition and have earned decorations and other honours on the field. The principle to be followed by this Government is that all who serve, and their dependants, shall be entitled to full provision in respect of the results of war service. To do otherwise would immediately lead to undesirable controversy as to the relative merits of the services of individuals. A very important reason why approval should not be given to the proposed new clause is that it would simply mean that in the majority of cases, where claims for a war pension had been refused, the application would be made for the grant of a compassionate allowance. Experience has shown that it is almost impossible to argue that any soldier did not have meritorious service. Moreover, in view of the tightening up of the onus of proof clause in the bill, the onus would be on the commission to prove in each ease that meritorious service had not been rendered. This would be a most invidious task. The result can well be imagined, because every soldier to his friends and comrades is a hero. It is considered most undesirable to suggest that a pension should be paid to soldiers on a compassionate basis. One principle only should govern the granting of pensions under the Repatriation Act. 

New clause negatived. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">New England</small>

-- I move - 

  >That, after new clause 17a, the following new clause he inserted: - " 17b. Section thirty-six of the Principal Act is amended - 
  >
  >by inserting before the proviso the following sub-section :  -  (2.) Any such pension may be allowed to any such person under this provision as well as to the widow of any member of the Forces.'; and 

My desire is to right what I regard as a very great wrong that is being done to many legal wives of soldiers, who receive no assistance by way of a pension when the husband has been killed, the natural or  *de facto*  wife receiving the whole of the amount payable on account of his death. After 1920, discretionary power was given to the commission to make the pension payment to both the legal and the natural wife. An amendment made in 1940 provided that, in respect of members of this war, the pension could be paid to either the legal or the  *de facto*  wife, but not to both. 

##### Mr Jolly:

--  Is the honorable member proposing that both shall receive it? 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- I am proposing that the commission shall have discretionary power. If it decides that the pension shall be payable to both, it will be. A  *de facto*  wife may have been living for only a few years with the soldier subsequently killed, whereas the legal wife may have been a good wife to him for very many years. The Minister has replied to representations that I have made concerning a signaller who was killed on the 18th April, 1941, leaving a natural wife, an adopted child, and two ex-nuptial children residing in Victoria. He had also a legal wife. The commission, in its deliberations, took into account that, owing to the duration of the association, on a marital basis, of the soldier and the  *de facto*  wife - that is, from about" 1936 - he was the  *de facto*  husband of the woman for only five years, during a portion of which time he was away at the war; but, because there had been issue, and also because the soldier had made a will in which he had appointed his  *de facto*  wife executrix and sole beneficiary, the commission gave the whole of the pension to her. It probably had no other course open to it. On the other hand, the legal wife had been married to him for very many years and may have been extremely good to him. He may have left her through no fault of her own. Yet she was deprived of the right to a pension by the alteration made to the act in 1940. It cannot be argued that what I am proposing has not been done under other legislation of this Parliament. Under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act, the National Security (Civil Defence Volunteers) Regulations, and the  National Security (War Injuries Compensation) Regulations, provision is made whereby both the legal and  *de facto*  wife may receive 50 per cent, of the pension. The Widows' Pensions Act provides that a  *de facto*  wife and a legal wife may each receive the full pension. I ask the Government to agree to the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act being brought into line with the Widows' Pensions Act, and the committee to approve of that course. 

##### Mr Calwell:

--  Under the Widows' Pensions Act, it is possible for three women to receive a pension in respect of the one man. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- I am not so modern in my treatment of the subject; I am considering the case of only two women. 

The cost involved would probably not be great. The commission would have the discretion to make a double payment, if necessary. The honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron)**  said last night that he is not in favour of any compensation being paid to  *de facto*  wives. He added that living with a woman to whom one is not married is an immoral act, and should be stopped. The effect of the act at present is to give compensation by way of a pension to the woman whom the soldier alleges has sinned. I wish to obtain some justice for the legal wife, who has probably committed no sin. If she has sinned, and the commission considers that she is unworthy of being assisted, it will have discretion to refuse the pension. 

##### Dr PRICE:<br><small class="text-muted">BOOTHBY, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; UAP</small>

--  Are the children also covered ? 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- I understand so. The children are innocent victims of either mother. Absolute control would be in the hands of the commission. I therefore appeal to the Minister to accept the proposed new clause and thus bring this legislation into line with the Widows' Pensions Act as well as with the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act as it was before being amended in 1940. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- I regret that I cannot accept the proposed new clause. We, and I believe the special committee also, have given a good deal of thought to the position in regard to  *de facto*  wives. We have decided not to give them that designation. We say that a man has a wife, and do not go farther than that. The matter is difficult to administer. We like to act in accordance with the wishes of the soldier. If he has had a mistress who has borne a family to him, and he wishes to provide for her before he goes away to fight, the Army guarantees that it will look after her if anything happens to him". We had to deal with a very distressing case a little while ago. A woman who had been living with a. man for twelve years had four children by him. I understand that she was a good woman to him. He left Australia.  His  legal wife had never been in communication with him during the twelve years, hut when she learned that he had been killed she applied for a widow's pension. 

##### Mr Abbott:

--  The commission need not grant a. pension in such a case. 

M.r. Mokoan.  -  The position might be reversed - the innocent woman might be the lawful wife. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- Is the commission to be made the judge of whether the husband or the wife is in the right? That would put the commission in a very awkward position. 

##### Mr Abbott:

--  It is being done now. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- With due respect to the honorable member, who is trying to do what is right, I contend that we should do what the man wishes. If he makes an allotment to a mistress, makes provision for the children, appoints her his sole executrix, and leaves all his property to her, the commission has no alternative except to grant the pension to the mistress. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">REID, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

--  What would be the position if he is paying maintenance to his legal wife while living with a  *de facto*  wife ? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- We would do what he wished when he went away. 

##### Mr Coles:

--  What about the injured wife? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- The commission investigates each case. If the soldier leaves everything to the woman with whom he has -been living, and makes an allotment to her, we generally adopt a similar course. I know that some cases are very distressing. 

##### Mr Sheehan:

--  The Army continues maintenance payments to the deserted wife. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- At times, it makes a payment to both. In the last war, the Repatriation Department either divided the amount or gave a percentage to each, the two combined not exceeding the full amount. I cannot undertake to interfere with the present practice. 

##### Mr Ryan:

--  Will the honorable gentleman say what the position is in regard to the children of both the  *de facto*  wife and the legal wife? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- Pensions are payable to the children of both, at the rates provided. 

##### Mr JOLLY:<br><small class="text-muted">Lilley</small>

.There is a good deal of merit in the amendment. This Parliament should give some consideration to the interests of the legal wife, whatever may be the desire of the man. The committee will be interested to learn from the Minister (Mir. Frost) why the policy which had been in existence up to 1940 was altered. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  I do not know the reason. 

##### Mr JOLLY:

-- Under the Widows' Pensions Act, both the  *de facto*  wife and the legal wife receive the widow's pension. This Parliament made a great mistake when it provided for  *de facto*  wives in that legislation. I agree that, if the woman concerned needs assistance, the Parliament should grant it ; but it should be by means of a special provision" outside the Widows' Pensions Act. It is a pity that the two have been mixed. In the present instance, the position of the legal wife is being made worse; as a matter of fact, preference is being given to the  *de facto*  wife. That is a great mistake. 

No  mention of a  *de facto*  wife should be made in either this legislation or the Widows' Pensions Act. Any assistance which the Parliament might give, should come out of a special fund and be given by way of a special grant. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

-- The Minister for Repatriation has not understood what the honorable member for New England  **(Mr. Abbott)**  desires to do. He has stated that the policy of the commission is to give effect to the wishes of the soldier, and to protect the woman whom he had loved and cherished and desired to protect. The proviso inserted in 1940 enabled the commission to disregard that woman. The point made by the honorable member for New England is that the wishes of the soldier may be defeated if there is a rival claimant for the pension in the person of the legal wife. The honorable member desires to ensure that, if there are two claimants, the commission may, in special circumstances, give effect both to the soldier's wishes and to the claim of the legal wife by paying both. Under the law as it now stands, that cannot be done. 

##### Mr FRosT:

--  Does the honorable member suggest that a full pension should be paid to both women? 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- That is the suggestion. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  I am afraid we could not do that. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- It would be done in very special circumstances only. This system of making provision for the  *de facto*  wife originated as a voluntary idea. A man who desired to enlist would wish to make provision for the woman with whom he was living. Although she was not his actual wife, he cared for her as if she were. In Canada, in the United States of America and Australia legislation has been passed providing for such cases. It may be desirable to insert a provision making it clear that the commission shall exercise its discretion in this matter in special circumstances only. Of course, the commission need not consider the claim of any but the legal wife if it chooses. 

##### Mr POLLARD:<br><small class="text-muted">Ballarat</small>

-- I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. I do not wish it to be thought that I am  seeking official approval for loose living or immorality, but I am concerned with facts. Under the law as it now stands it is possible for the legal wife to be deprived of a pension. 

##### Mr Abbott:

--  And she might have been living with her husband until six months before his death. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- That is so. It would be best to revert to the system which operated after the 1914-18 war, under which the commission was given the right to pay a pension to one or both women. The commission is a responsible body, and could be relied upon to give the matter careful consideration. I realize that this is a touchy question, and that various organizations will raise objections as soon as it is suggested that justice should be done to both women in the case, even though both may be equally unfortunate and equally innocent. The previous arrangement worked satisfactorily for more than twenty years; it was not varied until 1940. We should remember that, apart from the women concerned, there are also the children to be considered. I do not think that any honorable member would wish to penalize the children of an irregular union of the kind we have been discussing. 

##### Mr Jolly:

--  As a matter of fact, under the present proposal, the  *de facto*  wife will be placed in a better position than the legal wife. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- That is so. Then I take it that the honorable member supports the amendment. 

##### Mr Jolly:

--  Yes, with some reservations. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- All we are asking is that the commission may, at its discretion, give a pension to one or both women. I do not altogether agree with the. principle of taking the soldier's wishes into consideration. Unfortunately, there are bad soldiers. and it is possible that a man might deliberately do an injustice to a perfectly virtuous woman. Therefore, we should revert to the position which existed before 1940. I know that church organizations and moralists will upbraid us for making this suggestion, but we cannot overlook the facts. No one can seriously suggest that if the committee accepts the amendment it will be encouraging the formation of irregular alliances. People do not enter into such alliances for the sake of getting a pension, but because they are the victims of unfortunate circumstances or have a warped outlook on the relations which should exist between men and women. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Batman</small>

-- I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for New England  **(Mr. Abbott).**  There is a growing tendency in this Parliament of males to derogate dangerously from the status of the married woman. I believe that if there were a woman member of this Parliament, a voice would have been raised which would have impressed honorable members and the public outside with the importance of the status of married women. I understand that the honorable member for New England now seeks to cure the ill effects of an amendment which was made to the Repatriation Act in 1940 under which, in practice, discretion was allowed to the soldier himself to choose between the person with . whom he had entered into the solemn contract implicit in marriage and the person with whom he formed an irregular subsequent union. I entirely dissent from the view that the final dictum in this matter should rest with the soldier. I do not presume to pass judgment on any person who errs. I adopt the language of the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin),**  when he said on a recent occasion that he was too conscious of his own human weaknesses to pass censure on other people. I adopt that as applying to myself, but I do say that, interwoven with the whole social structure, and a fundamental factor in the preservation of a self-reliant and progressive society, is the family. I entirely agree with the honorable member .for Lilley  **(Mr. Jolly),**  who said - as, indeed, I have myself said on previous occasions - that it was to be deeply regretted that we ever allowed to pass into common use, whether as a marginal note or for purposes of correspondence or for adoption in a statute, the obnoxious phrase,  *" de facto*  wife ". The honorable member for New England does not ask for a great deal. He asks merely that the wife - and I refuse to adopt a phrase suggesting a recognition of any competitor - should be placed in the position of at least having a look-in when it comes to the disposition of the bounty of theState. At least she might be suffered to start on equal terms with the concubine. 

##### Mr Mulcahy:

--  She deserves better treatment than that. 

##### Mr BRENNAN:

-- I agree. We should, at least, restore the pre-existing law, the benefit of which we thoughtlessly took away from the married woman. I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter. This is one of those cases in which all questions of party loyalty must give way to one's fundamental conception of right and wrong. I feel very strongly, upon the matter, and in any vote designed to improve the position I shall endeavour to ensure that the wife at least starts on equal terms with her illicit competitor. I am sorry to appear to have to dissent from the view that the Minister has expressed, because he has laboured hard and effectually in dealing with this bill. He has displayed great patience and ability, and I take the opportunity to tender my thanks to him for the good work he has accomplished in supporting the just claims of returned soldiers; but I ask his reconsideration of the matter before the committee, because, unquestionably, it should be reconsidered and a wrong righted. 

##### Sir EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

.: - Before the amendment is finally disposed of, the Government should give consideration to the fact that the divorced wife of a soldier could be in a much better position than his legal wife. Section 38 of the principal act states - 

  >In the case of any person who was the wife of a member of the forces (including a member of the forces within the meaning of section forty-five at of this act) but who has been divorced, and who, at the time of the occurrence of the event resulting in the death or incapacity of the member, was dependent upon alimony payable by the member, a pension equal to the amount of a widow's pension or to the amount of alimony, whichever is the less, may, upon the. discontinuance of the payment of alimony, be allowed to that person. 

As the act stands at present, with the 1940 amendment, a legal wife who has been faithful to her husband, would receive no pension - although the claims of her children would be recognized - because the husband, for a period before he left for the war, had lived with another woman and made a certain settlement in her favour. The legal wife might be perfectly innocent, and she should be in at least as good a position as a woman who had been divorced. If there were a  *de facto*  wife, she would be entitled to a pension, whilst a divorced wife would be entitled to alimony or to the pension equivalent of it. In those circumstances a grave wrong would be done to the woman who was the legal wife. I take it that under the ordinary law the husband would be responsible for her debts. So it seems to me that the Parliament would be quite wrong in liberating the Commonwealth and the people of Australia from the responsibilities of the husband under the law of the land to the time he died. I support the amendment of the honorable member for New England. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

.This amendment raises an important principle, although the sum involved is not large. I am acquainted with a case which shows that the right to allot the payments should not be left to the discretion of the soldier himself. A woman, who is a constituent of mine was shamefully neglected by her soldier husband, who refused to make any allotment to her. lie went away with another woman prior to enlisting. She could not get any allotment herself, because at that time the allotment had to be made by her husband in her favour. She had to apply to a court for maintenance, and she had some difficulty in getting her husband served with the necessary notice, because he had enlisted under a false name. She obtained a maintenance order, but he said that he would not make any allotment , to her. That happened during the time when the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)'**  was Minister for the Army, and as a result of that case the making of allotments became compulsory. In that instance the soldier was vindictive towards his innocent, legitimate wife. If the procedure proposed in the hill be adopted, that wife, in the event of her husband's death, will receive no allowance whatever. Some discretion should be allowed to the commission in this matter, because difficulty will arise only in exceptional circumstances. The special committee recommended that both women might participate in the pension, but that only one pension should be paid and it might be divided between the two women. The amendment proposed by the honorable member for New England  **(Mr. Abbott)**  goes farther than that, and would, in some cases, involve the payment of a double pension. That would be necessary only in a limited number of instances, and the sum involved would not be large. I take it that the commission would exercise its discretion wisely. It would weigh the whole of the circumstances, and probably there would be children to both the legitimate wife and the  *de facto*  wife. It would be only fair that an allowance should be made to each, because they would have to support the- children and look after them, and in many instances would not be able to take up outside work. The Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  said that the department should not be under the obligation to go into the merits of the respective claims of the wife and the other woman; but, after all, that has already been done by the Department . of Social Services. In the case of a deserted  *de facto*  wife, or widow, the department can pay a pension; but it has to be satisfied as to the facts of the case. A similar procedure could be adopted by the commission, so that justice would be done to both of the women concerned. 

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Melbourne</small>

-- The amendment proposes to restore the position that existed prior to the passage of the amending act in 1940. No honorable member has yet explained why the principal act was amended  hi  that year. It would be interesting to know whether it was because of financial considerations, or whether other reasons actuated the government of the day. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">REID, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

--  The department probably knows what sum was involved. 

##### Mr CALWELL:

-- I cannot conceive that it was large. Since 1940 the Widows' Pensions Act has been passed, and under that measure Parliament recognizes the right of at- least three women to draw pensions in respect of the one man. It is possible, in the event of that man's death, for a divorcee, a deserted wife and a  *de facto*  wife all to draw pensions, because at one time or another they were either married to him or living with him. It is necessary to adopt a uniform principle with regard to the Widows' Pensions Act and the Repatriation Act. Some honorable members have, by interjection, stressed the difficulties that may arise if the, amendment be carried. Brigham Young had, I believe, about 17 wives and 56 children, and it is well that the Repatriation Department has not been called upon to deal with a problem such as he would have presented. It is far better to pay two women than to deny justice to the legal wife. An outrageous principle is incorporated in the act as it now stands', when we say that the man concerned shall have the right to determine who shall receive the pension from the Repatnation Department. 

I ask honorable members to consider what would be the position in actuality. A man deserts his wife in order to live with another woman. Is it likely that in one case in a thousand such a man would say, " My wife is the person who shall draw my pension when I die ", and disavow any claim of the woman who alienated his affections? The act now says, in effect, that the rights of the deserted wives have been extinguished by the mesalliance that her husband formed. If she had obtained a maintenance order against him she may have been able to do something in the courts, but a great many husbands disobey maintenance orders and some have been repeatedly gaoled, on the application of wives, by order of the court for not having complied with maintenance orders. Often, too, the woman for whom a man has left his wife has had children by him, and she pleads with the man's wife not to continue to have him committed to prison because of the suffering cast upon his little children. 

##### Mr Brennan:

--  Many good women fear the public scandal of prosecuting erring husbands. 

##### Mr CALWELL:

-- Yes, and other women have abandoned their legal rights and allowed maintenance orders to lapse, because they have found it to be too expensive to keep on having their husbands committed to gaol. In every case the wife has suffered. The proposed amendment will restore her rights, at least under this act. If we have to choose between the present provisions of the act which denies the right of the widow, and another, which previously existed, in which the widow's rights were safeguarded, I should prefer the latter. I, therefore, propose to vote for the amendment moved by the honorable member for New England  **(Mr. Abbott).**  I think that the overwhelming feeling in the committee is in favour of the amendment. If the Minister would consent to the postponement of the clause, he would be able to consult with his advisers and be in a better position to complete consideration of the matter later. That would be the wise course and I think that ultimately we could avoid dividing the committee on this issue. 

##### Dr PRICE:<br><small class="text-muted">BOOTHBY, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; UAP</small>

.I. feel that I must support the amendment. It is an extremely difficult matter, and I understand that it caused much worry to the special parliamentary committee on repatriation.We must admit that it is wrong that a widow and her children can be robbed of their pensions by a  *de facto*  widow and her children. One widow in Adelaide had to go. to work to support her child while the  *de facto*  widow and her children were pensioned. Whatever we do, we must not penalize the children. Many honorable members have received letters from well meaning people on such matters as this. One writer suggested that in order to improve morals it was necessary to cancel pensions when venereal disease was contracted. What a cruel anti-social outlook! How evil it would be to penalize the innocent for the sins of the guilty. If the amendment be lost I shall ask that this matter be referred to the proposed Standing Committee on Repatriation. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

-- I cannot agree with the honorable member for Batman  **(Mr. Brennan)**  that, if we had women in this Parliament, the  provision,  which the honorable member for New England proposes to amend, would not have been made. The Naval War Pensions Order of Great Britain, under the heading of "Unmarried Wives " - that is the term they use in Britain - contains the following order: - 

  >Eligibility for pension and rates. - (1) A woman who has lived as his wife with a man who has died in the circumstances  set  forth in Article 39 may, at the discretion of  the  Minister, be granted a pension not exceeding 10s. a week, provided that - 
  >
  >she had been wholly or substantially maintained by the man on a permanent bona fide domestic basis continuously from a date not less than six months prior to the commencement of the war or to his first employment with the Forces, if later, and was dependent on him at the date of his death; 
  >
  >(i) she has a child or children of the man in her charge eligible for allowance in respect of his death, or 
  >
  >she is, on his death, if childless, or on ceasing to have an eligible child of the man in her charge, as the case may be, in pecuniary need and incapable of selfsupport; 
  >
  >she makes her claim to pension within one year of the man's death. 
  >
  >A pension awarded under (1) may be continued until the woman ceases to have children eligible for allowances in her charge or ceases to be in pecuniary need and incapable of self-support. 
  >
  >Any pension granted under this Article shall cease on the marriage (or, if she is a widow, the remarriage) of the woman. Allowances for children under Article 44 or 46 may be paid after marriage or remarriage. 

Under the heading " Family Allowances ", the order provides that allowances may be granted to - 

{: type="i" start="i"}
0. has been wholly or substantially maintained by him on a bona fide domestic basis continuously from a date not less than six months prior to the commencement of the war or to his first employment with the Forces, and 
1. has a child or children of the officer in her charge eligible for allowance under this Article, or is over 40 years of age, or is incapable of self-support. 

That order was issued by the British Ministry, which contains women, and has not been disallowed by the House of Commons, which contains more women. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">New England</small>

-- The Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  declared that the amendment, if agreed to, would cause trouble in the. Repatriation Department through officers having to decide whether two pensions should be paid or not; but there must be the same trouble to-day, because the officers have to decide whether the pension shall be given to what I might describe as the " natural " widow or the real widow. All that the amendment asks is that the Repatriation Commission shall have the discretion to decide whether the circumstances justify the payment of a pension to each widow, de  *jure*  or  *de facto.*  The quality of mercy would not be strained if the Minister agreed to accept the amendment. 

##### Mr Blackburn:

--  The authorities in England have that discretion. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- Yes, the existence of the order cited by the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  proves that there is nothing in the argument that women resent pensions being paid to  *de facto*  widows. It is of the essence of justice that wives or widows should not be deprived of their rights by  *de facto*  wives or widows, with whom a man may have lived for only a short space of time. 

I ask the Minister to accept the amendment, and I would like the matter to be decided by the committee now. 

##### Mr RYAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Flinders</small>

-- I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for New England. I am sure that the overwhelming opinion of this committee must be in favour of safeguarding the position of a woman whose husband has left her to make a home with another woman. That is all that matters to me, for I must confess that I do not mind very much what happens to women who have taken up with other women's husbands. I suggest that we should provide that the pension shall he paid to the widow, and that the  *de facto*  widow be provided for under the Widows' Pensions Act. That ought to settle the problem without further ado. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- I cannot agree to pay the pension to two women. I cannot see why the country should be saddled with the responsibility to provide for two widows, one  *de jure*  and the other  *de facto.* 

##### Mr Abbott:

--  But the Government has accepted the principle in the Widows' Pensions Act. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- I think that this would make too wide an opening. It is enough that the country should be required to pay £2 10s. to one woman in respect of the death of her bread-winner. It should not be saddled with £5 a week to be divided between two women in respect of the death of the same man. 

##### Mr Pollard:

--  That is punishing the innocent for the guilty. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- No. I do not apportion the blame. If the widow is able to establish her claim she receives the pension. I referred earlier in this sitting to a  *de facto*  widow with four children, with whom the husband had been living for twelve years, instead of with his wife. The widow made a claim for the pension, but it was not admitted. Probably that decision was justifiable. She had not troubled about her husband for twelve years. 

##### Mr Abbott:

--  My amendment leaves to the commission the discretion to decide whether one or two pensions shall be paid. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- I do not think that that w ould be justified. 1 urge the committee to leave the bill as it is. Should a soldier make an allotment in favour of a woman who is not his legal wife, his instructions are carried out. If his legal wife had been looking after him, she can obtain justice; if not, what claim has she on him? 

##### Mr Jolly:

-- What about the wife who had not been living with her husband? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- I know that there are cases of hardship; but we cannot legislate to meet every such case. We cannot be the judges of the persons concerned. I do not like some of the things that are done; but I cannot agree to payment being made to two women. 

##### Mr Abbott:

-- That i3 done under the Widows' Pensions Act. 

New clause agreed to. 

New clause 39a. 

##### Mr COLES:<br><small class="text-muted">Henty</small>

.- 1 inove - 

  >That, after clause 39, the following new clause be inserted : - "39a. After section fifty-six of the Principal Act, the following Part is inserted: -

(2.) Two of the members of the Committee shall be members of and appointed by the Senate, and four of the members of the Committee shall be members of and appointed by the House of Representatives.  (3.) A Minister of State, the  President  of the Senate, the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives and the  Chairman  of Committees of either House of the Parliament shall be ineligible for appointment as a member of the Committee.

Every member of the Committee shall, before entering on the duties of his office or sitting at any meeting of the Committee, make and subscribe a declaration in accordance with the Form in the Sixth Schedule to this Act. ' :':n - (1.) Any member of the Committee may resign his scat on the Committee by writing under his hand addressed to the  President  of the Senate if he be a  **Senator, or**  to the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives if he be a Member of the House of Representatives.  (2.) The seat of any member of the Committee shall also be deemed to have become vacant if he ceases to bc a  **Senator or**  a member of the House of Representatives (as the ease may be ) .  5,6 E. Where a vacancy occurs in the Committee, it shall be filled by appointment according to the practice referred to in section fifty-six a of this Act within thirty days from the happening of the vacancy if the Parliament is then sitting, and, if not, then within thirty days after the next meeting of the Parliament.  56f. At any meeting of the Committee, four members shall form a quorum.  56c. - (1.) There shall be a  Chairman  and a Vice-Chairman  of the Committee, who shall be elected by the members of the Committee at their first meeting, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.  (2.)

The Committee shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, consider and report  to the Parliament upon every matter affecting repatriation which either House of the Parliament, by resolution, refers to the Committee and upon every other such matter affecting repatriation referred to the Committee by the Minister.' ". 

My motive in moving that a parliamentary standing commitee on repatriation be appointed is to ensure that a permanent body shall be set up, with power to make exhaustive inquiries into any of the many questions which are sure to arise in the administration of this legislation. The great value of having such a committee was proved by the excellent work done by the special committee which reported to the Minister  **(Mr. Frost),**  and on whose recommendations this bill is based. Those benefits will be retained by the appointment of a permanent standing committee. I shall not speak at length, because the Minister has indicated that the Government is prepared to accept the new part. Proposed new sections 56a to 56l are identical with sections in that part of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act under which a parliamentary standing committee on broadcasting has been established. I believe that such a committee will be of great value to the Minister and the Parliament, as well as to soldiers in general, particularly the federal executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which, no doubt, will be the body through which most of the recommendations to the Minister will come. 

##### Mr JOLLY:<br><small class="text-muted">Lilley</small>

.- I shall not oppose the proposed new part; but I take this opportunity to draw attention to the fact that we are creating so many committees that it is impossible for members of Parliament to give proper attention to the functions of such bodies. Some honorable members are on several committees. The time has arrived when the Government should overhaul the various committees now in existence and their functions. ' In my opinion, the number of committees should be considerably reduced. It would be better to have a few standing committees with definite functions to perform. The functions of the proposed committee are clearly set out and are limited to matters affecting repatriation which either House of the Parliament, or -the Minister, refers to it. In my opinion, some of the committees now in existence are making work for themselves, and are spending time on such work which could be spent otherwise to better advantage. Proposed new section 56c requires every member of the proposed committee to make and subscribe a declaration in accordance with the form set out in the sixth schedule. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Public Works; but, so far as I know, I have not been required to make any such declaration. I ask the Government to give serious consideration to a reduction of the number of committees. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- The Government does not oppose the insertion of the new part. The Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin)**  promised to accept it, because he realized that the special committee had done a good job. Should any matter affecting servicemen arise on which the Minister desired information, he could refer it to the standing committee for investigation. The intention is not that the committee shall investigate individual cases, but rather that it shall deal with matters of principle, or such matters as the extension of the number of hospitals or sanatoriums. It will be observed that, the committee will deal only with matters which are referred to it. I do not think that the committee will need to meet often; but its establishment will mean that an investigation of any particular matter can be made quickly should that course be considered desirable. As to the value of committees, I can speak with some experience, because I was a member of the committee which, after investigation, reduced the loss associated with the acquisition of apples and pears from £1,500,000 in one year to less than £300,000 in the following year. Many of the existing committees are doing good work and are saving the country large sums of money. 

##### Mr Anthony:

--  That saving was not due to anything done by the committee. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- I think that the committee had a good deal to do with the saving. For a number of years I was  a member of the Standing Committee on Public Works and I know that on many occasions its investigations resulted in considerable savings. That occurred, for instance, in connexion with the proposal to erect a hostel in Canberra. The honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis),**  who was  chairman  of the committee at that time, will bear out my statement. The committee proposed to be established under this measure should be of great assistance to servicemen. 

##### Mr Hughes:

-- Will its members be soldiers? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- I do not know that they should necessarily be soldiers, but the parties which will nominate members for appointment to the committee may decide to nominate ex-servicemen. The Government has no objection to this proposal. 

##### Mr SPOONER:<br><small class="text-muted">Robertson</small>

-- I support the amendment. The considered opinion of such committees, like the recommendation of the special committee to increase the rates of pensions by 20 per cent, under this measure, is a reassurance to honorable members like myself who, in view of the special committee's considered view, did not feel justified in supporting an amendment of that recommendation without being perfectly sure of being able to offer a thoroughly sound alternative. Without a committee of this kind we cannot establish a real liaison between bodies like the returned soldiers' organizations and members of the Parliament. One weakness disclosed in the debate on this bill was the fact that whilst some honorable members desired to increase the rates of pension by 33 per cent., others suggested 50 per cent., whilst others thought that an increase of approximately 25 per cent, might have been justified. It is quite evident that members of the Parliament, while they are on the run, as it were, and with the limited information and statistics available to them, cannot be expected to oppose their individual judgment to the considered views of a committee on a subject which the committee has investigated. However, decisions which are to form the basis of the treatment of problems, such as soldiers' pensions, demand careful inquiry, and, in some cases, the hearing of evidence from interested bodies, and a study of problems in association with officials of the department who can make available all relevant statistics. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">REID, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- And these committees are free from party politics. 

##### Mr SPOONER:

-- Yes ; the committee system will remove the consideration of the problem of soldiers' pensions from the arena of party politics. The proposed  committtee  will submit to the Parliament reports based on the wisdom of all its members. I do not agree with the objections of the honorable member for Lilley  **(Mr. Jolly).**  I admit, however, that the committee system can be overdone. 

##### Mr Jolly:

-- I do not object to the appointment of the proposed committee, but point out that some of the committees already appointed by the Parliament overlap. 

##### Mr SPOONER:

-- I shall not judge the wisdom of establishing this committee on the ground that there are too many other committees. The appointment of this committee is justified. It should be established on the basis- on which the Broadcasting Committee is already functioning. That principle is sound; and I should like to see it extended to social legislation. Whether the quantum of benefits to be allowed to beneficiaries is fair or unfair is a matter of opinion. Individually, we cannot obtain all information necessary to enable the Parliament to deal thoroughly with many problems. Some honorable members may be justified in thinking one way and some another way; but only by intensive study over a period of weeks can we arrive at a thoroughly sound decision. More than the mere consideration of £ s. d. is involved in these matters. The problem of soldiers' pensions, for instance, is a human, as well as a financial, problem. We may require to know what is being done in this respect in other countries. We must study changing conditions as the war progresses, and also what the Parliament is doing with regard to other classes of pensions. All such considerations enter into the matter in addition to the mere aspect of £ s. d. Parliament cannot ordinarily give to those matters the consideration which they demand, unless it has before it a concrete proposal for discussion. 

I do not agree that the appointment of this proposed committee is unnecessary. It is thoroughly justified by the debate which has taken place on this bill. I say, frankly, that but for the knowledge that the Government was going to accept this amendment, I should have found myself obliged to reconsider my attitude towards the proposal to increase the rates of pension under the bill by 20 per cent.; I, personally, do not think that that increase is sufficient to meet present conditions although it might have been sufficient to meet the conditions existing when the special committee concluded its deliberations nearly six months ago. The proposed committee will keep abreast of developments in the repatriation sphere, although it need not sit regularly, because it. will deal only with matters referred to it by this House, or the Senate, or the Minister. It will not have power itself to initiate inquiries. It is not very likely that subjects will be remitted to the committee very frequently. However, a doubt still exists in the minds of honorable members generally whether the rates of benefits and pensions agreed upon under this measure are fair. Such a subject could be referred to the committee; and it would reassure honorable members generally to know that the matter was being intensively studied by a committee constituted in this manner. The right honorable member for North Sydney  **(Mr. Hughes)**  asked whether the committee would be composed of returned soldiers only. No provision is made in that respect. The proposal is that the committee shall consist of four members of the House of Representatives and two members of the .Senate. The special committee consisted entirely of returned soldiers; but there can be no guarantee that that will be the case in the future. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- No such guarantee should be given. 

Air. SPOONER,- That is so. It may be advisable to appoint an honorable member to the committee because of his special knowledge of the subject. A particular honorable member may be personally acquainted with the operation of repatriation legislation in other countries. I should imagine that a wise government would see to it that a substantial propor tion of the members of the committee were ex-servicemen. I accept the proposed new provision because it will give to the House during the months ahead some guarantee that should the bill prove to be inadequate to meet existing conditions our decisions under the measure will be further reviewed and adjusted accordingly. I sincerely hope that the amendment will be adopted, and that as soon as possible after the measure is proclaimed the Government will ask the committee to be set up to examine the new rates of pensions in relation to existing conditions. 

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Melbourne</small>

.- I congratulate the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles)**  on proposing this amendment, and commend the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost)**  on accepting the principle embodied in it. The principle has already been adopted by Parliament with respect to other legislation. Section 84 of the Australian Broadcasting Act, which deals with the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting, reads - 

  >The powers, privileges and immunities of the committee and its members shall, subject to this part, be those of each of the Houses of the Parliament and of its members and its committees. 

It is highly desirable that the powers, privileges, and immunities of the Broadcasting Committee be also enjoyed by the proposed repatriation committee. Indeed, it might prove to be dangerous to deny this protection to the proposed committee. I hope that the honorable member for Henty will embody that provision in his amendment. It is desirable that the committee should have all the powers, privileges and immunities now enjoyed by Parliament itself in order that neither the committee nor any of its members may be embarrassed with litigation for doing something for which no member of the Parliament could be proceeded against. I think that that omission from the honorable member's amendment is unintentional. I also suggest that the amendment might be improved in another respect, although the matter I am now about to raise may be controversial. The Australian Broadcasting Commission Act provides that the Minister or either House of Parliament may refer any  matter to the committee; but it also provides that the Minister shall refer to the committee any such matter which the Australian Broadcasting Commission, or the body known at the commencement of the act as the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations, ' requests him to refer to it. Similar provision should be made with respect to the proposed repatriation committee. The 

Minister  should be obliged to refer to the committee any matter which the Repatriation Commission, or the body known as the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, requests him to refer to it. Several honorable members opposite appear to fail to understand that the principles on which  the  proposed committee  is  based are wise, practical and beneficial. 

##### Mr Jolly:

--  But the system can be abused. 

##### Mr CALWELL:

-- Any system can be abused. The parliamentary system and the executive system can be abused ; but the principle involved in the amendment strengthens the Parliament in relation to the Executive, because the committee is to consist of members of both Houses - in practice this means members of all parties - who will he equally as well advised on repatriation matters as is the Minister himself; and the committee must report to the  Parliament,  and not to the Minister, on any matter so referred to it. Thus, the proposed committee, which will probably be the same as the special committee whose report formed the basis of this measure, will be an integral part of our repatriation machinery. There is nothing wrong with that. The commission can play its part, discharging its special responsibilities under the act; and the committee can deal with such matters as are referred to it, and so play an equally important part in advising honorable members from time to time on all matters of major importance affecting repatriation. Committees which have been appointed by the Parliament either as statutory bodies, or in the form established under the National Security Act, have already justified their existence. Mere hostility to the committee . system, and attacks such as those uttered by the honorable member for Adelaide  **(Mr. Stacey)**  on previous occasions, which, no doubt, he will utter again when he gets the call from the Chair, do not destroy the validity of any of the contentionswhich have been advanced in support of the principle of the amendment.. The more we have of the committee system in our parliamentary structure, the better it will be for the Parliament, for the Executive, for all persons concerned with the legislation involved, and for the people generally. In the Congress of the United States of America, every bill that is introduced is referred to an appropriate committee of each House and reported upon before debate ensues, in order that its passage may be as speedy as possible. In the British House of  Commons,  the  President  of the Board of Trade, for instance, and he is only one of several Ministers similarly empowered, can, and does, set up committees to examine various proposals, and these committees have done extremely valuable work in making recommendations which subsequently have been embodied in legislation. Some of that British legislation has been copied in this country. Therefore, I cannot see that any real argument can be advanced against this principle, and I strongly urge the proposal now before the committee, and in again congratulating the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles)**  I urge him to include the substance of section 84 of the Australian Broadcasting Act in his amendment. I ask him also to consider the advisability of recognizing the right of the Repatriation Commission to refer matters to the proposed standing committee through the Minister, because the time may come when a Minister for Repatriation will be at loggerheads with the Repatriation Commission, and may misuse his power in the same way as some honorable members have suggested that parliamentary committees may misuse their power. I contend that the federal executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is competent to bring matters of moment under the notice of the proposed standing committee, and that the  Minister  for Repatriation should be obliged to submit to that committee any matter placed before him by that thoroughly representative organization. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:<br><small class="text-muted">Parkes</small>

-- I am in favour of appointing parliamentary committees to deal with matters of national importance, particularly public works, but repatriation is an entirely different matter. If we are to have a parliamentary standing committee on repatriation, why should we not also have parliamentary standing committees on army matters and such subjects as invalid and old-age pensions? I submit that every honorable member of this chamber has a responsibility to see that justice is done to the returned soldiers and their dependants. I do not wish to criticize the parliamentary committee whose report formed the basis of this legislation, because I consider that that body did an excellent job. It presented a good report, which, as I have said, has been largely incorporated in this measure; but that should finish the work of the committee. In view of the thorough overhaul now being given to  repatriation  legislation, I trust that there will be no occasion, in the near future at least, to make further alterations to it. If, however, further adjustments become necessary, say, through an increase of the cost of living, surely such matters could be determined equitably by the Minister for Repatriation in conference with the Repatriation Commission. My fear is that the setting uo of a standing committee on repatriation will result in undue interference with the work of the Minister and of the Repatriation Commission which is a quasi-government body. In addition, the proposed body would be called upon to undertake an immense amount of work because of the many questions that would be raised. 

##### Mr BARNARD:

--  Surely that could be overcome quite easily. 

##### Sir CHARLES MARR:

-- It could be overcome, but I do not think that it would be. Much as I admire the work that has been accomplished by the parliamentary committee, I contend that its usefulness has now ceased and that Parliament would be well advised to leave the responsibility of carrying on the job to the Minister and the Repatriation Commission. 

##### Mr MORGAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Reid</small>

-- I am pleased that the Government has agreed to accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles),**  first, because I was one of those who advocated the setting up of an allparty parliamentary committee to investigate repatriation matters, and, secondly, because I have also advocated the appointment of a standing parliamentary committee on repatriation. 1 am pleased also that it is to the honorable member for Henty that credit for placing this proposal on our statute-book will go. I was disappointed that the parliamentary committee did not accede to my request, which I made so far back as August last, that members of Parliament be given an opportunity to place their views before it. However, in a letter to the committee I made the following suggestion: - 

  >The precedent set in the Broadcasting Act by the setting up of a Parliamentary Standing Committee might well be followed in regard to Repatriation so that same, and the administration thereof, would bo constantly under the purview of Parliament and many of the injustices complained of would be automatically dissipated. 
  >
  >This would constitute a more democratic form of control and in keeping with the principles the war is being waged for. 
  >
  >There would also be much constructive work for the Committee and it would be in a position to act promptly to meet each situation that may result from war conditions and we would not have such occurrences as happened in the case of disabled Militiamen for whom no provision for pension had been made after two and a. half years of war. This happened to a constituent of mine, an original Anzac who was in the landing at Gallipoli, served four years in the last war and sixteen months in this one as a member of the Home Forces, yet on being discharged in January of this year, following an injury sustained while in the service, he found himself without pension, sustenance, employment, and he ended up on the dole. 


 **His** application for a pension was refused on the ground that there was no provision in the Repatriation Act covering his case. The result was that, because of his disability, he was unable to obtain employment, and he ended up on the dole. That occurred two and a half years after the outbreak of the present war. Had the administration been fully alive to the situation, it would have made provision for such cases, and that unfortunate soldier would not have been obliged to go on the dole despite the fact that his disabilities resulted from war service. I realize that new problems arising out of this war keep the administration very busy, and there can be no doubt that a standing committee on repatriation would be of great assistance to the commission in dealing promptly with various anomalies that arise from time to time. Members of Parliament are constantly receiving representations from their constituents on repatriation matters, and they would be pleased to have an opportunity to put their problems before such a committee. In addition, there are many other matters which the proposed body could investigate, such as land settlement for returned soldiers, after care, vocational guidance, housing and so on. The payment of a gratuity to soldiers returning from this war is also an important matter. There is no reason why that question should not be discussed and determined now, so that soldiers will know what to expect when the war is over, and the payment of a gratuity will not be made a political football, as was the case after the last war.  I  have no doubt that if a parliamentary standing committee on repatriation were in existence at present, much of the acrimonious debate that has taken place on this measure would have been avoided. Honorable members could have placed their views before that committee, and many problems could have been solved without being ventilated in this chamber. Even the increase of pension advocated by certain honorable members opposite could have been discussed; in fact, I see no reason why the honorable member for "Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  should not place before the standing committee his views in regard to an increase of pension rates. I trust also that the proposed body will investigate the possibility of consolidating the Repatriation Act in order to present it in a  Hunch  simpler form than it is at present. The problem of small pensions about which many complaints have been made in this chamber could also be tackled. 

I agree with the suggestion of the honorable member for Melbourne  **(Mr. Calwell)**  that the returned soldiers' organizations and the Repatriation Commission should have recourse to the proposed standing committee in the same way as the Australian Broadcasting Commission has recourse to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting through the Postmaster-General. When the Broadcasting Commission or the Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations makes representations to the Postmaster-General on a particular matter, there is an obligation upon him to refer that matter to the standing committee. Similarly, the reference of repatriation matters to the proposed standing committee should not be left to the discretion of the Minister for Repatriation. After all, the ex-servicemen are the people most vitally concerned in repatriation matters, and they should have direct recourse to the proposed standing committee, through the Minister. If it be necessary first to satisfy the Minister or Parliament that a matter is one that should be discussed by the committee, there will be unnecessary waste of time and useless repetition of discussion. In fact, there would be no need for the committee at all. Therefore, I agree with the suggestion of the honorable member for Melbourne.  The precedent already has been established in the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act, and I hope that it will be followed in this case. Matters affecting returned soldiers and their dependants should be thrashed out thoroughly in a non-party atmosphere. In his second -reading speech upon this measure, the Minister himself said that it should be above party politics, and the same sentiment has since been expressed by the Prime Minister  **(Mr. Curtin).**  My only regret is that we on this side of the chamber have been bound to a large degree by party decisions, and have not had the same freedom to speak upon these matters as has been enjoyed by honorable members opposite. In many respects, we have been hamstrung in this debate, and have had to sit idly by while motions embodying principles with which we were entirely in accord were submitted by honorable members opposite. 

##### Mr HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">North Sydney</small>

-- I shall support this amendment, because I consider that it is a good one. In his second-reading speech the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  suggested the setting up of a  standing committee on repatriation, the functions of which he outlined briefly. I agree with the honorable member for Robertson  **(Mr. Spooner)**  that the recommendations of the parliamentary committee were a material factor in assisting decisions to be made in regard to many repatriation matters. From the inception of the repatriation legislation it has been my practice to consult with the soldiers, and I have been guided by them on many occasions. I can say, with justification, that I have been guided by them and by none other. The original rate of pension was fixed on the recommendation of the soldiers, and increases have been made from time to time, so far as I am aware, on the advice of soldiers' organizations. Practically every amendment of the act has originated in the soldiers' organizations, through which the returned man has made himself articulate. The parliamentary committee which was appointed to deal with this matter accomplished its work so ably that honorable members, almost with one accord, are desirous of making the committee a permanent part of the mechanism of this Parliament. ' 

##### Mr WARD:<br><small class="text-muted">EAST SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP; LANG LAB from 1932; ALP from 1936</small>

-- What matters should the standing committee deal with? 

##### Mr HUGHES:

-- One honorable member suggested that the committee should make its report to the Parliament. I agree with that view. I support the proposal to appoint a. permanent committee, because it will be charged with the special duty of acting as a liaison between the returned soldiers' organizations and the Parliament. It will attend to duties that it is well qualified to perform, and it should submit at least an annual report. But the committee should not be galvanized into activity only when matters are referred to by the Parliament. It will protect the welfare of returned men, and bring urgent matters before the Parliament. I strongly support the proposal, for, if the Parliamentary Standing Committee had not been proposed, I, like the honorable member for Robertson  **(Mr. Spooner)**  should not have been able to support the government in limiting the increase of the rate of pension to 20 per cent. 

##### Mr STACEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Adelaide</small>

-- I sincerely congratulate the parliamentary committee which compiled the recommendations for the amendment of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. Having studied its proposals most carefully, I consider that the committee did an excellent job. All members were returned soldiers who were well qualified to recommend to the Government proposals for improving the present repatriation system. This bill is based upon the recommendations of the committee. 

The committee, which was appointed to do a specific job in a limited time, admirably discharged its responsibilities. However, I object to the number of committees that has been appointed, first, by the Menzies Government, and, later, by the Curtin Government. The committees, which were appointed two years ago, were given important work to do, but I believed that their inquiries would be completed within a month. I was mistaken. Their number has been increased, and some honorable members are attempting to serve on three of them. One honorable member, who is associated with several committees, told me that he did not know which meeting to attend. The committees have travelled widely in the Commonwealth, with large and expensive staffs, and many of their reports have not been, and never will be, studied.  *I*  resigned from one of the committees a fortnight ago, although I believed, when I became a member of it nearly two years before, that I could render useful service. The committee was given two important jobs. First, it investigated the proposals for the construction of the Canberra Community Hospital and submitted to Parliament certain recommendations, of which I was justly proud. Some honorable members, defending the appointment of the committees, declared that their investigations have saved the Government large sums of money. I shall recount my experiences. The proposal to erect the Canberra Community Hospital was examined by the Public Works Committee. 

##### The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN" (Mr Martens:<br><small class="text-muted">HERBERT, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- The bill contains no reference to the Canberra Community Hospital. I ask the honorable member not to digress. 

##### Mr STACEY:

-- I am endeavouring to show why the repatriation committee will not be a success. The estimated cost of the construction of the new hospital was £134,000. Although the buildings have not yet been completed, the expenditure on the building to date is £1/8,000. The Public Works Committee also investigated the proposal for the construction of the new abattoirs in the Australian Capital Territory. The estimated cost of the work was £32,000, but the expenditure will exceed that figure by nearly £30,000. Those examples illustrate the futility of inquiries by committees. Often their recommendations are disregarded without examination. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting has done some good work, but its action in recommending continued publication of the  *A.B.G. Weekly*  has aroused keen criticism. 

##### The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:

-- Order! The bill contains no reference to the  *A.B.O. Weekly.* 

##### Mr STACEY:

-- I am positive that infinitely better work could be done without the appointment of the Standing Committee on Repatriation. Once the committee is appointed it will become permanent and will find for itself plenty of work to do. Its inquiries will necessitate long trips to distant parts of Australia. The proposed committee will get into the same rut as that into which previous committees have fallen. Its expenses will be considerable and I consider that better work could be done through the Minister and the department. 

The number of Cabinet Ministers has been increased, and departments have expanded enormously. The whole position is farcical. I shall not support the proposed appointment of the Standing Committee on Repatriation. Another reason why I object to the committee is that the Standing Committee on Broadcasting recommended the continuance of the  *A.B.C. Weekly,*  although its losses total £600 a week, and only 3 per cent, of the licenceholders subscribe to the journal. From those remarks honorable members will understand that I am definitely opposed to the appointment of parliamentary committees. 


 *Sitting suspended from 12.^5 to 2.15 p.m.* 


##### Mr BARNARD:<br><small class="text-muted">Bass</small>

.- I am glad to know that the Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  has agreed to accept the new clause proposed by -the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles).**  The committee system of doing our business may be open to criticism, but I think that that is very largely a matter of one's point of view. Having had some experience of committees working for this Parliament, I am quite satisfied that the all-party committee system does very useful work, provided that the committees' recommendations are acted upon by the government of the day. I believe that the proposed repatriation committee will serve a very useful purpose. It will give an opportunity to the Minister to have questions inquired into, it will be an avenue through which the commission itself can have matters referred to it. provided that the Minister is prepared to do so, or it will provide an opportunity for members of the Parliament to have subjects referred to it for investigation. Repatriation over the years has been a subject of very great controversy, and I believe that in the future the work of this Parliament will be considerably lightened and much more expeditiously performed if we are able to have such subjects referred to a committee, a report made to the Parliament, which can subsequently be discussed, and the recommendations considered not only by Parliament but also by the Government of the day. I heartily agree with the new part, and support it. 

##### Mr HARRISON:<br><small class="text-muted">Wentworth</small>

-- I shall oppose the new part proposed by the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles),**  because I think that if anything should convince honorable members of the foolishness of having such a committee as a standing committee, it should be the results of the debate in this chamber. It appears to me that on every occasion on which an honorable member challenged the committee's report in any way at all, certain members of the committee took it as a personal affront. They appeared to think that, because they had been appointed to investigate repatriation problems on behalf of the Government, every honorable member should have surrendered his rights as a representative of the people, and fallen in completely behind the committee because it had given attention to this subject. Strangely enough, we find that some members of the committee have come briefed with a sheaf of amendments altogether contrary to the committee's recommendations, proving conclusively that the committee itself did not investigate the whole position thoroughly. Yet, repeatedly, when  we  make suggestions from this side of the chamber we are told to be good boys and sit down, because the whole subject has been investigated, everything is in hand, and all is right with the world. I disagree entirely with that point of view, and I can see only a repetition of this sort of thing if the special committee which has been sitting is converted into a standing committee. We have a parallel to the proposed committee, in many committees in existence. The Broadcasting Committee is a severe headache to the commission, and, I should say, to the Minister also. We have appointed a commission to administer the provisions of the Repatriation Act. It has done a really good job, and its work will be extended, following the the proclamation of a new Repatriation Act. Side by side with the commission is the Minister. If  Ave  appoint a committee to cast its shadow over both the commission and the Minister, the commission will be unable to do its work satisfactorily, whilst the Minister will not be able to give the necessary attention to the task he has in hand. Therefore, both he and the commission will become mere ciphers, subject to examination by the committee itself. With all due respect to the members of the proposed committee, I do not think that -it will provide a complete representation of the views of members in this Parliament. If we are simply to delegate our duties to a committee appointed from both sides of the House, we may just as well pack up our bags, and leave the whole task in the hands of the committee. Another objection, I think, suggests itself. We know that on one side of the House sits a party which is rigorously disciplined. It has to obey the rules of caucus whether it believes in them or not. We have had instances of this when members on the other side of the chamber have been members df a committee and signatories to its report. Indeed, one member pointed out in the debate that they were handicapped by not being given the liberty which honorable members on this side enjoy. Whilst we have three members from one side of the chamber rigorously disciplined, who, once they have signed on the dotted line expressing the wishes of their party, are not permitted to depart from the committee's recommendations, and even ready to interpret Government policy, we are likely to have a lop-sided committee. Honorable members on this side, who are not disciplined by caucus methods like honorable members opposite, but are more or less free-lances, are placed at a disadvantage. Such a committee cannot reflect impartially the decisions of its members, or the views of all parties in the chamber. For these reasons, I oppose the appointment of a committee. 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Wakefield</small>

--  The reference made by the honorable member for Wentworth  **(Mr. Harrison)**  to the Broadcasting Committee is very much to the point. When that matter came before us in June of last year, I expressed the opinion that there was no need for such a committee, but the recommendation for the appointment of a permanent committee had been made by the Joint Committee on Broadcasting. No recommendation has been made in this case by the special committee that it should continue to act, or that some other body of a similar kind should carry on in the future. 

##### Mr Rosevear:

--  That is due to the modesty of its members. 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:

-- That may be so, but we have no assurance that the committee which is to be appointed will be identical with the one which made the report which has been before honorable members during the debate on this bill. All of us agree that the committee has done good work in the preparation of its report. Having said that, I am free to discuss the whole matter without being suspected of antagonism to any individual. The question is, whether there is to be a permanent committee to deal with repatriation which may or may not be composed of returned soldiers, who. may or may not be identical with, those who sat on the special committee. With that premise, we may discuss the proposal broadly on its merits. I consider that, if any committee ought to be reconstituted just now it is not the special committee, but the public accounts committee, which is much more needed in this country at the present time. The amendment of the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles)**  is a lengthy one, and contains a good deal that is of interest. For example, the members of the committee, when appointed, shall hold office as a joint committee for the duration of the Parliament, but ' shall cease to hold office as soon as the House of Representatives expires by dissolution or effluxion of time, or upon their ceasing to be members of Parliament. Thus it is not to be a continuous committee, but will be subject to disruption at any time by contingencies over which it will have no control. The proposed new section  56j  provides - 

  >The committee may, subject to this section, sit and transact business during any adjournment or recess as well as during the session, and may sit at such times and in such places, and conduct their proceedings in such manner, as they deem proper. 

The most important of the proposed new sections is  56l,  which proposes - 

  >The committee shall, subject to the provisions of this act, consider and report to the Parliament, upon every matter affecting repatriation which either House of the Parliament, by resolution, refers to the committee and upon every other such matter affecting repatriation referred to the committee by the Minister. 

Those are very wide powers indeed. There are indications that the committee will be expected to do a considerable volume of work. I state quite clearly that, in my opinion, such a body would not be the appropriate one to act as a consultant to the Minister. The honorable gentleman is himself vested with certain powers, and may take such advice as he thinks fit. The responsibility will be his alone. If he requires advice, it can be furnished to him by the Repatriation Commission, which is the prime body in this matter. Should he consult it, he will not have the overlapping that is inseparable from a series of committees dealing with work of the same type - which is always undesirable. But if, on the other hand, the decision is that there must be a reference to some other body, I consider that a preferable body would be the returned soldiers' league which already has branches in the various States, and a great deal of material which would assist its work from the beginning. Not only could it do this work in a specialized sense far better than it could be done by a parliamentary committee, but, in addition, it would not be torn from its duties in the way in which a committee appointed from this Parliament would be. I have always understood that " one man one job " was one of the objects of the Labour party. That is a theory to which I do not subscribe; but having members of Parliament performing all sorts qf other duties, and being liable - as they undoubtedly will be in this instance - to be drawn to all the States, one cannot expect them to be able properly to carry out the prime duties that they have been elected to perform. 

For the reasons that I have given, I consider that it is not desirable that this committee should be appointed, and I shall vote against its appointment. 


 **Mr.** rosevear  (Dalley) [2.30].- 1 have already said that, to a very large section of the community, this is a vital piece of legislation, concerning which there has always been a considerable degree of controversy, contention and difficulty. On that account, there are good reasons for the appointment of a standing committee. But there are equally good reasons in opposition to such a proposal. So far as I can see, the proposal of the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles),**  with the addition which the Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  proposes to accept, will place that honorable gentleman in the position of being a mere cipher in the control of repatriation matters. The original proposal of the honorable member for Henty contained quite enough power to enable the committee to be called together. That could be done by a resolution of either House of the Parliament. I suppose it can safely be said that, with a due sense of its responsibility, neither House of the Parliament would request the calling together of the committee except to investigate something that was substantially wrong. The original proposal further provided that the Minister himself, if he considered that difficulties were likely to arise and that he ought to be informed from an outside source apart from those contesting the matter, could request the committee to furnish a report to him. The returned soldiers' league might be at loggerheads with the Repatriation Commission.. The Minister might not be sure as to which body was right and which wrong. Desiring to be advised, he could enlist the aid of the committee. But, under the present proposal, which, I understand, the Minister intends to accept, he will be in grave danger of becoming a mere cipher. It provides - 

  >The Minister shall refer to the committee any such matters concerning repatriation which the commission or the federal executive of the Returned Soldiers Association requests him to refer to the committee. 

I cannot visualize any possibility of the Minister rejecting such a request, 

##### Mr Frost:

--  The matter will have to pass through the Minister. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- The Minister will have no alternative; he will have to refer the matter to the committee. The addition to the original proposal has been made by the honorable member for Henty at the instance of the honorable member for Melbourne  **(Mr. Calwell).**  The proposed amendment is as follows : - 

  >The Minister shall refer to the committee any such matters concerning repatriation which the commission or the federal executive of the Returned Soldiers' Association requests  him  to refer to the committee. 

This provision departs entirely from the proposed new part which the Government was prepared to accept from the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles)**  in which it was provided that requests might be referred to the committee by the Minister or the Parliament. It is now proposed to give an outside authority power to order the Minister about. 

##### Mr Calwell:

--  That is not its meaning. 

##### Mr ROSEVEAR:

-- It is, unless plain English words have lost their meaning. While I can see nothing wrong with the proposed new part of the honorable member for Henty, I warn the Minister that if he accepts the amendment of the honorable member for Mel- bourne  **(Mr. Calwell),**  he will become a mere cipher who may be ordered about by an outside authority. 

##### Mr MARWICK:<br><small class="text-muted">Swan</small>

.- I approach the consideration of this proposal with mixed feelings. I have sat on parliamentary committees which have done useful work, and have reported either to the Prime Minister or to Parliament. In no previous instance have the members of a parliamentary committee taken any important part in sponsoring, in this Parliament, legislation embodying recommendations of the committees, of which they were members. This right has been reserved for the members of the special committee on repatriation. I have supported its recommendations because I believed them to be sound, but, during the last two days we have  witnessed the deplorable spectacle of members of the special committee, while reserving for themselves the right to move amendments to clauses embodying their recommendations, at the same time attacking all and sundry who dared to move other amendments. Surely it is the right of every honorable member to move amendments if he feels that he can improve the bill before the committee. Our experience in connexion with the Broadcasting Committee was very different. A non-party measure was introduced into Parliament based upon the recommendations of the committee, and it was considered by honorable members in a non-party spirit. In thE case of this bill, however, while government supporters have stuck solidly to the measure, opposition membershave fought among themselves over many of its provisions. If that is to he the result of the parliamentary ' committee system, then the sooner it is abandoned the better. I have a strong suspicion that this committee system will develop; and if it does, then so far as repatriation is concerned, I see no reason for having a Minister for Repatriation or a Repatriation Commission. Why not go a little farther? Why not do as has been done in the United States of America, and vest the parliamentary committee itself with complete power? 

##### Mr Calwell:

--  It might not be a bad thing if parliamentary committees had more power. 

##### Mr MARWICK:

-- That may be so, but I do not want to see Ministers of the Crown reduced to mere ciphers. Every honorable member who spoke on the motion for the second reading of the bill congratulated the committee on its report, yet there were 50 odd speeches delivered on the second reading. I believe that the returned soldiers are capable of seeing for themselves that they get a fair deal in the future. I am prepared at all times to listen to representations from their properly constituted organizations. The league can submit proposals to the Minister, but I do not believe that it, or any other outside body, should have power to direct the Minister what he shall do. Therefore, I propose, with great reluctance, to vote against the proposed new part. 

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Melbourne</small>

.- I submitted my suggestion for the improvement to the proposed new part in perfectly good faith, and I did so because there is a precedent for it in the Australian Broadcasting Act which was passed last year. The very words of the amendment to which exception is taken were copied verbatim, with the exception of an alteration of terminology by substituting the word "repatriation" for the word " broadcasting " from subsection 2 of section 85 of the Australian Broadcasting Act. The objections of the honorable member for Dalley  **(Mr. Rosevear)**  were not raised by any other honorable member in this chamber, or in the Senate, when the Australian . Broadcasting Bill was under discussion. The sub-section referred to states - 

  >The Minister shall refer to the Committee any such matter which the Commission or the body known, at the commencement of this Act, as the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations requests him to refer to the Committee. 

The Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations is as much an outside body as is the returned soldiers' organization. 

##### Mr Abbott:

--  It is a commercial body. 

##### Mr CALWELL:

-- Yes, it represents the interests of 100 commercial broadcasting stations, and it is by no means so important in the social, national and general life of the community as the returned soldiers' organization. The argument being advanced now about ministerial responsibility could have been put forward about nine months ago when we were considering the broadcasting measure, but it is really only an afterthought. The bogy of danger to ministerial responsibility has been destroyed, and should not influence one vote in this chamber. The joint parliamentary committee set up under the Australian Broadcasting Act has dealt with many matters referred to it by the Postmaster-General. I have not heard from that Minister or any other member of the Government, or from any member of either House of this Parliament, that section 85 of the act has undermined ministerial authority in any respect. We talk about ministerial responsibility, but may I offer the suggestion that, .because of the absence of a standing committee of the kind contemplated, and because of the over-emphasis that has been laid upon ministerial responsibility for the last twenty years, we have had to wait that time for an amending repatriation bill. Had the committee system operated earlier, and had there been less desire on the part of a few Ministers to subordinate the whole of the interests of the Parliament to their particular interests as Ministers, there would have been better legislation by this Parliament and more progress in this country than there has been. The talk of ministerial responsibility leaves me cold. By seeking to strengthen the proposed new part submitted by the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles),**  I thought that I was helping to give to the Parliament as a whole some share in the responsibility of shaping repatriation policy in the years to come. After all, it is not the Ministry which controls the destinies of this country. Parliament, over the centuries, has always been jealous to see that neither the King nor the Executive invades its rights and privileges. The whole history of parliamentary government is one long story of the parliament insisting that its authorityis paramount. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will agree to my amendment of the amendment of the honorable member for Henty. If he will not, I hope that he will accept it in an amended form by the substitution of the word " may ". for the word "shall". That would be better than nothing. There can be no argument against the incorporation of the returned soldiers' organization, through its federal executive, in the work of repatriation in the years that are opening before us. This country will have to accept the responsibility and discharge the duty of rehabilitating the 800,000 men and women who constitute the fighting forces of Australia to-day. 

##### Mr MENZIES:<br><small class="text-muted">Kooyong</small>

.- I do not like the proposal before the Chair at all, and I should like it less if it were amended in the direction sought by the honorable member for Melbourne  **(Mr. Calwell).**  I shall offer my reasons for my attitude briefly. I am not opposed to the idea of- a parliamentary committee; indeed, it would be very odd if I were, because a great number of the committees now sitting were set up as the result of decisions given by myself. So I am not right in line with my friend, the honorable member for Adelaide  **(Mr. Stacey),**  in thinking that the committee idea is, of itself, bad. Every case must be judged on its own ments. In this case, we are dealing with something which is quite different from broadcasting. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is hot concerned with administration, but with policy. The chief executive officer of the commission is the general manager, and he acts under the policy direction of the commission. The Broadcasting Committee sits, not to discuss matters of administration, but matters of policy, and it offers as a representative committee views on policy which the Government may not think fit to include in its broadcasting policy, or to convey in its own fashion to the Broadcasting Commission. But, with regard to repatriation, we have an entirely different problem. 

I have not previously spoken on this matter, or on this bill, and so, perhaps, I shall be permitted to say that no commission in Australia, in the last twenty years, has had to undertake so difficult a task as has the Repatriation Commission. Composed primarily of returned soldiers, it has had to stand between the returned soldier, with his just and imperative claims, and the community, the Government and the tax payer. It has occupied a position which is, in a peculiar sense, judicial. Having had seven years' ministerial experience in this Parliament, I do not believe that any commission has a better record of service than the Repatriation Commission. It has performed a most delicate  of all tasks, and I believe that, broadly, it has done it conscientiously and wisely. I take this opportunity to express my acknowledgment to the commission of the work that it has done. It has deserved very well of this country. 

The proposal is that we should have a Repatriation Committee. For what purpose? If it were to be a committee that would report upon matters referred to it by either House of the Parliament by resolution, such as that of the pension quantum that has been discussed in this case, I should entirely support it. In addition -to that, it is to report on every matter that may be referred to it by the Minister for Repatriation. There is no need for me to tell the present Minister that I have no quarrel with him, because he has brought before this country a wise and just Repatriation Bill which will do great credit to him when it goes on to the statute-book. -But no Minister is permanent,- and, if we establish the position that any Minister for Repatriation, confronted with a difficult problem, which may be primarily a problem of administration, can refer it, not to the administrative body, the Repatriation Commission, but to a parliamentary body composed of politicians, I very much fear that we shall not have a non-political administration of the repatriation legislation, but a political administration. Nothing could be worse than that. The whole point of the work of the Repatriation Commission has been that it is removed from party politics, its business being to act as agent between the returned soldier and the civilian, a difficult task which, as I have said, has been splendidly performed. It has been said that Parliament must not abdicate its responsibilities. The Minister is responsible to Parliament. He is the man who, in the long run, must and will accept responsibility for the administration of repatriation. I, as a member of Parliament, am content that the Minister should be in his place on the treasury bench, willing and able to answer for the administration of his department. It is vital to a proper handling of the problem that administration through a commission acting under the Minister should be in the first place non-political, and in the second place that it should not be duplicated by the settingup of two authorities which may appear to exercise equal authority. Let me give an example. I see the Minister for the Army  **(Mr. Forde)**  on the treasury bench. The administration of the Army involves the making of important decisions on matters of policy. It involves the organization and use of troops. But it also, as we all know, involves a host of little questions  affecting individuals which are sent to the Minister, and which have to be dealt with' in an administrative way. What would happen if the Minister for the Army were to be told by Parliament that, in the future, he must administer his department under the general supervision of a small parliamentary committee ? 

##### Mr Archie Cameron:

--  That was recommended before the sitting was suspended for luncheon. 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- Maybe. If that system were instituted, the Minister, perhaps not this one, but some other Minister for the Army, if a human being, would say, " If these things are to go to a parliamentary committee, let them go there in the first place. I am not going to bother my head about them. Let the committee administer and deal with these matters ". The Minister would be in an intolerable position if he had to give a decision subject to appeal, not to the Parliament, not to the Prime Minister, not to his colleagues, but to a committee of Parliament. I venture to say that no self-respecting Minister for the Army would want to undertake the task of administration in those circumstances. 

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

--  Utter absurdity! 

##### Mr MENZIES:

-- Of course, the honorable member for Melbourne, whose passion foi" the parliamentary committee system will begin to diminish only when he is admitted to the Ministry, says, " The perfect idea is to have parliamentary committees ". The first object of administration is to get work done, to get it done justly, and to uphold the authority of those who have to do it. The proposal before the chamber now will inevitably undermine the authority of the Repatriation Commission. What will happen to the  chairman  of that commission and his colleagues if, all the time, when a matter comes before them in the ordinary course of administration, they are given -to understand by some honorable member or members of Parliament that, unless the matter is dealt with in a certain way, they propose that it shall be dealt with by the parliamentary standing committee? I repeat that this committee will not be like the Broadcasting 'Committee, of which my friends, the honorable member for Boothby  **(Dr. Price)**  is a member and the honorable member for Melbourne is  chairman.  The Broadcasting Committee Ls not concerned with administrative matters. It is not deciding as between Jones and the Crown or Brown and the Crown. It is concerned with what should be the broad policy of broadcasting in Australia. On that sort of matter a parliamentary committee can do first-class work, but I repeat that a proper understanding of the administration of this country requires that no parliamentary committee shall be an administrative body. Administration is for the Government of the country and for the heads of the departments and commissions which operate under the Government. The best service will be rendered to Australia when that principle is recognized and when, if any one has the desire to discuss administration, he can discuss it plainly across the chamber with the Minister concerned. But duplication and division of authority will not bring reputation to the parliamentary system. I should like the Minister to say, not that he will accept the proposal as a whole, but that he will provide for a committee that will deal with matters referred to it by either House of Parliament by resolution. If that were done, large issues would be- referred to the committee, but we should not have the same real danger from the corporate wisdom of members of the committee in those circumstances as we should otherwise have. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">Barker &middot; ALP</small>

--  I was pleased to hear the right honorable member for Kooyong  **(Mr. Menzies)**  speak on this matter, because,  as he said in his opening remarks, he personally was largely responsible for the very luxurious growth of committees of this Parliament. 

##### Mr Duncan-Hughes:

-- Luxuriant ? 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- Luxuriant, too. I meant what I said. I think that no single act of policy inside this Parliament has done more to subvert the usefulness and authority of this Parliament in the last two years than has the policy of setting up extraneous committees. 

##### Mr Calwell:

-- The right honorable member for Kooyong also devised the Advisory War Council. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- Another body and most useless of the lot! It will be a bad thing if this standing committee on repatriation is established. I think that the set-up will become impossible if we have a committee which will be a sort of buffer for the Minister for Repatriation. The game of " passing the buck " politically is not unknown to some of us in this chamber. It will reach its grandest pretensions if the proposed committee is established. The administration of the Repatriation Act must be entrusted to the Minister of State for Repatriation. If he is not able to do that job with the assistance of the Repatriation Commission, the quicker he is replaced the better. If we are to have a committee of half a dozen honorable members who, if the speech of the mover of the new clause, the honorable member for Henty (Mr; Coles) is correct, will be able to move from one part of Australia to another like a lot of " Meddlesome Matties " and " Nosey Parkers ". Any time some one likes to refer a matter to it, the position of the Minister for Repatriation and the Repatriation Commission will become utterly impossible and the only result must be chaos. If, however, a committee is to be established the suggestion of the right honorable member for Kooyong  **(Mr. Menzies)**  is the only sensible thing to do. The committee should be restricted to the investigation of matters which are referred to it by either House of the Parliament. I prefer, however, that the proposal before the committee bo not accepted. I am at a loss to understand how the Government could have main tained such a rigid front on certain other matters within the last few days, and yet have given in so easily on a matter of this description. The position of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia in this matter must not be overlooked. The league is a highly organized body throughout Australia. If, in the opinion of soldiers, anything goes wrong it is brought before the Minister for Repatriation; and if he does not take notice of the representations made to him, various branches of the league will soon get in touch with members of Parliament, and action willbe taken. As the result of my experience, [ say that, regardless of the department of which a Minister took charge, if he had a committee of this description butting in between him and heads of departments, between him and the Parliament, and between him and the people, an impossible position would soon be reached. I have never denied that committees have their usefulness. That they can serve a good purpose was revealed recently by the way in which the special committee which reported to the Minister in connexion with repatriation matters did its job. Having completed its task, it ceased to exist. The broadcasting committee is different. I am one of many who have never been quite sure that that committee ought to have been set up, but I can sec nothing of value to the soldier, the administration, the Parliament, or the taxpayer emerging from the appointment of a Repatriation Committee. We had better look that fact in the face now, and decide not to establish it. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">Warringah</small>

.- I share the misgivings expressed by the right honorable member for Kooyong  **(Mr. Menzies)**  about committees, but, at the moment, I am more concerned to make certain that the rates of pension shall be reviewed. I am determined that shall be done, and, therefore, I am prepared to accept the proposal of the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles),**  provided that certain words be added f.o it. I therefore move - 

  >That  the following new sub-section he  added  to proposed new section  56L  - " (2.) The Committee first appointed under this Part shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, within three months after its appointment, consider the matter of the adequacy of the rates of pension payable under this Act, and shall, within fourteen sitting days of the Parliament after the expiration of that period of three months report to the Parliament on that matter.". 

I want to make certain that the umbrella which we have been told is being provided for the protection of soldiers does not contain too many holes. My amendment would give a definite direction to the committee to deal with the adequacy of the pension. 

##### Sir GEORGE BELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Darwin</small>

-- I see no virtue in adopting the proposed new part. The idea of appointing a committee to examine proposals to be placed before the Parliament is not new. As the honorable member for Melbourne  **(Mr. Calwell)**  said, the Congress of the United States of America has had a committee system in operation for many years. Every proposal for legislation is examined by the appropriate committee. The committee system operates also in the British House of Commons. Happenings in this Parliament, however, during this week should convince honorable members that the committee system would be of little value in this Parliament. Ever since the honorable member for Moreton  **(Mr. Francis)**  spoke on Tuesday last there has been an almost continuous debate on  this subject. We have had an excellent committee in operation. Almost every member who has risen to speak has praised the committee for doing what he described as " a fine job of work ". Nevertheless, as the debate proceeded,  speaker  after  speaker  indicated that the judgment of the special committee was wrong. Such matters as the rates of pensions, eligibility for a pension, the person to whom the pension should be paid - matters into which the special committee had inquired - were discussed, notwithstanding that the special committee was much better informed on those subjects than were the members in this chamber. It can be said, too, that the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is, in general, better informed, and more sympathetic regarding the needs of the returned soldier than are most members of Parliament. The league devotes its energies to the interests of service men. Some of its most prominent officers do little else. They work without hope of reward. I am convinced that they are more concerned for the welfare of this country in general than are many members of this Parliament who have spoken on this subject. The special committee was guided largely by the opinions of those men, and I had hoped that the Parliament also would have been guided by them. The debate in this chamber this week does not reflect credit on the Parliament, nor does it commend the committee system. Immediately «a bill is introduced in the Congress of the United States of America it is referred to the appropriate committee. That committee examines the proposition; but, I repeat, the presentation of its reports is not followed by a week's debate in Congress on the subject upon which the committee has reported: If we intended to follow a similar course in this Parliament I should support the proposal. However, my faith in our committee system has waned considerably during recent years, and, particularly, during the last few weeks. I now consider it to be of little, or no value. The Repatriation Commission is a competent body. It is better informed upon repatriation matters than any committee appointed by this Parliament could inform itself over a period of months, or years. The commission advises the Minister; and the Minister is responsible to this Parliament for the administration of the Repatriation Act. It is now proposed to appoint a standing committee to inquire into every matter which the Minister may be requested by returned soldier organizations to refer to it. The commission and the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia are mentioned as the most suitable bodies to submit requests for such inquiries. Any branch of the latter organization which is dissatisfied with decisions of the commission could ask the Minister to refer such matters to the proposed committee. We can easily imagine what will happen. Obviously, the proposed committee will not be free from party politics. The Minister will be able to refer to it any matter as he himself decides. In those circumstances, ministerial responsibility will go by the board. Does any honorable member seriously suggest that the proposed committee will be capable of giving more reliable advice to the Minister than is now made available to him by the Repatriation Commission ? That , body devotes its whole time to its work. I shall not support the proposal. It will not be beneficial to returned soldiers. Certainly, it will not help the Minister. The committee system is excellent in theory, but it is not working out well in practice in this Parliament. After the exhibition we witnessed in this chamber during the last two days, when honorable members examined in detail each recommendation of the special committee, although the members of the committee, as the result of their investigation, were better informed on the subject, I have lost faith completely in the committee system. 

##### Mr HUTCHINSON:<br><small class="text-muted">Deakin</small>

-- I oppose the inclusion of the proposed new part. I . do not suggest for one moment that the Government, intends to make the proposed committee an administrative body. I am sure that that is not in the mind of the Minister  **(Mr. Frost),**  and that only matters involving general repatriation policy, and matters directly related to the administration of the commission - such as eligibility for pensions, and rates of pensions - will be submitted to the committee. However, I foresee that if the Minister failed to keep a tight rein on the committee it might very easily develop administrative functions. Should that happen, all the disabilities mentioned by the right honorable member for Kooyong  **(Mr. Menzies)**  and the honorable member for Darwin  **(Sir George Bell)**  would arise. It is for the following reasons I oppose the adoption of the proposed new part. The Minister is in direct charge of the Repatriation Department. He is assisted by the commission, whose virtues have been extolled by the right honorable member for Kooyong. The commission has the services of a  deputy  commissioner in each State, whilst every co-operation is given to the department by the various returned soldiers' organizations, which are virtually the watch-dogs of repatriation in Australia. Therefore, no necessity exists for the proposed committee. Indeed, such a body will cause duplication and extravagance. If many of our existing committees, along with quite a number  of  business boards, were wiped out,  ire  should obtain more efficiency and expedition in our war effort. 

##### Mr COLES:<br><small class="text-muted">Henty</small>

.-Nothing contained in the proposal which I have submitted suggests that the proposed committee shall be an administrative body in any respect. The proposal simply is that the committee will carry out functions similar to those which have been performed by the special committee upon whose report the bill is based. The proposed committee may consider and report only upon such matters as are submitted to it by a resolution of either House  of  the Parliament, or by the Minister. I am prepared to embody in my proposal the two amendments suggested by the honorable member for Melbourne  **(Mr. Calwell),**  provided the Minister is allowed to exercise his discretion as  to  what matters. he may ask the committee to investigate. I am entirely opposed  to  making it mandatory for the Minister  to  refer all matters to the committee which the commission, or the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia may ask to be investigated. As a matter of fact, the Minister already has power under proposed new section 56l to refer any matter  to  the committee for investigation. However, as the Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  has stated that he is willing to accept both the honorable member's proposals, I fin quite willing to embody them in mine, provided the honorable member for Melbourne is prepared to make the alteration which I have indicated, and thus allow the Minister to exercise his discretion as to what matters he may refer for inquiry to the committee. I oppose the amendment moved by the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender),**  which provides that the proposed committee shall consider and report to the Parliament within three months upon the new rates of pensions fixed under this measure. Any honorable member can move in that direction at any time. 

I believe that the proposed committee can investigate and solve many knotty problems which deeply concern the people whom our repatriation legislation is designed to benefit. Certainly, the committee will relieve the Minister of many of his burdens. The description of the proposal as a buck-passing proposal is unjustified. Surely, we can put aside party politics and consider repatriation problems without bias. Such an attitude towards our repatriation legislation will enable all parties to pull together. Indeed, it may bring nearer the formation of a national government. 

##### Mr RYAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Flinders</small>

--  I have no objection to the principle involved in the setting up of this committee, but I have certain objections to the details of its proposed functions. The Repatriation Commission has done a good job in the past, is still doing a good job, and I have no doubt will continue to do so in the future, provided that its administration is not interfered with. Under the constitution of the proposed standing committee, for reasons very well explained by the right honorable member for Kooyong  **(Mr. Menzies),**  there is every probability that the work of the commission will be interfered with. If that could be avoided, I should be prepared to support the proposal, and I suggest to the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles)**  and to the Government that adequate safeguards would be established if the word " policy " were added after the word " repatriation " wherever occurring in proposed new section 56l. The effect would be that the committee could report upon any matter affecting repatriation policy. That would remove any possibility of the committee interfering with the administration of the Repatriation Commission. I trust that the honorable member for Henty and the Government will accept my suggestion. 

##### Dr PRICE:<br><small class="text-muted">BOOTHBY, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; UAP</small>

.-There is much to be said in favour of the establishment of a standing committee on repatriation. One good reason is the unity, peace. and accord which usually is associated with committee meetings, in contrast to the envy, hatred and malice which too often is evident in parliamentary debates. To those who would attack the committee system, I point out that the envy, hatred and malice displayed in the course of this debate has not come from members of the special committee which investigated repatriation matters, but from other interests in this chamber. This debate has shown that the setting up of the proposed committee is necessary in the light of the widely-held view in this chamber that amendments of the Repatriation Act will be necessary in the near future. The falling value of the £1 indicates that the proposed committee will be called upon to investigate certain matters almost at once. Strong support for the committee system has been expressed by Professor Bland, of Sydney University, who drew the attention of the Broadcasting Committee to the tremendous success of that system in the Congress of the United States of America, where important bodies such as the Foreign Relations Committee are now functioning, and in the British Parliament, where committees such as the Standing Committee on Estimates and Accounts is doing excellent work. Professor Bland's idea was that committees should not interfere in any way with a body such as the Repatriation Commission or the Australian Broadcasting Commission, but that they maintain an adequate liaison to keep Parliament in touch with developments and to advise Parliament on the various matters. With that end in view, it was laid down that the Broadcasting Committee should discuss only matters referred to it by either House of Parliament or by the Minister. The procedure that has been adopted is that should the committee find anything which it considers should be investigated, it asks the Minister to refer that matter to it. That practice has worked splendidly with the present Postmaster-General  **(Senator Ashley),**  but there is always a danger that a hostile Minister may seriously obstruct the work of the committee. 

I shall mention three practical points which have arisen from my experience of committee work: First, it is absolutely vital that parliamentary committees should confine their investigations to questions of principle and not deal with questions of administration. Once a committee starts to play around with the administration of bodies such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the Repatriation Commission or attempt to take into their own hands consideration of individual grievances which are not matters of general principle, the whole parliamentary committee system will become so cumbersome that undoubtedly it will collapse. Secondly, I am glad that under this proposal the suggested personnel of the committee is small ; it consists of only six members. This is a sma.ll Parliament of only  110  members, and we have not the personnel, nor do I . think that the country can spare the funds, to set up big committees. I am sure that my colleagues will agree that the Special Committee on Broadcasting which consisted 1 of six members, and which was under the chairmanship of  **Senator Gibson,**  was more workable than the new Broadcasting Committee with its personnel of nine. In that connexion, one calls to mind the story of a commission which founded one of the, Australian colonies. This consisted of ten commissioners, and which, allegedly, spent most of its time at meetings explaining to members what had "happened at the previous meeting. Perhaps that is an exaggeration, but it indicates the danger of unwieldy committees Personally, I should like to have seen the proposed committee even smaller than is now suggested. The third point I should like to make is one to which consideration might be given when Parliament meets again: It would be a great improvement if it were provided that a  chairman  of a parliamentary committee could not also be a member of another committee. ' Such a rule would mean that a  chairman  of a committee would be able to give his entire time to the work of that committee, to his parliamentary duties, and to his electorate. It is not fair to burden any man with an undue volume of committee work. In the past there have been instances of honorable members sitting on three or four parliamentary committees, and I contend that at least the  chairman  of a committee should have :no other committee work. 1 pay a tribute to the members of Parliament, who, in war-time, have carried out onerous duties on various committees. There has been much criticism of certain committees in this chamber, but, based on my experience on the Broadcasting Committee and on continual contact with members of other committees, my view is that these bodies have done a wonderful job for the country. 

At this juncture, I desire to counter the untruthful libel published in a newspaper recently. It stated that members of parliamentary committees did most of the work in their own States, and were paid allowances for doing it. As every one knows, members of committees, who work in their own States and home cities, do not receive an allowance. Members have devoted months to committee duties, and have never accepted one penny as travelling allowance, because they were residing in their own State. If certain sections of the press must throw slime at members of parliament, they should see that the slime is real, and not a tissue of lies. 

I have pleasure in supporting the appointment of this committee. The committee system has functioned most successfully in Great Britain and the United States of America, and I think it will be successful in the Commonwealth, particularly if the improvements which I suggested are adopted. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bourke</small>

.- I support the original !proposal of the honorable member for Henty  **(Mr. Coles),**  but I object to the amendment that he proposes to accept, and I shall not vote for it. The amendment to which I take exception provides that - 

  >The Minister may refer to the Committee any such mutter concerning repatriation which the Commission or the Federal Executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia requests him to refer to the Committee. 

The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is not controlled by the Executive  Or  by Parliament. The naming of this organization in legislation of this nature is unique. The Repatriation Act provides that any organization representing returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth may submit to the Minister certain names of desirable appointees to boards and the commission. I have no objection to the insertion of similar words, but I take exception to making the league the only body which can approach the Minister with a request to refer matters to the committee. The effect of the amendment is that the league will be the sole medium between the Minister and returned soldiers. This body has its own constitution. Recently it has favoured the policy of excluding from its membership members of the Citizen Military Forces,  or  soldiers who had not been sent abroad. Of course, the league has a perfect right to exclude from its membership whomsoever it pleases. 

##### Mr Anthony:

--  It has been considering a proposal to include members of the Citizen Military Forces. 

##### Mr BLACKBURN:

-- No body which arrogates to itself the right to exclude any returned soldier from its membership should be the sole medium of communication between returned soldiers and the Minister. I should not mind if the body were an organization including all returned soldiers without discrimination. But it is a great mistake to give to this organization, which is not controlledby the Executive or by Parliament, the monopoly of being the sole medium of communicationbetween returned soldiers and the Government, That principle is wrong. In addition to that, the league adopts policies upon national matters that are not the policies of all Australians, or of all returned soldiers. Some returned soldiers have refrained from joining the league because of its policies. I have no quarrel with the organization, but any national organization which has the power to exclude soldiers from its membership and does adopt policies not acceptable by all soldiers should not have the right to be the sole medium of communication between returned soldiersand the Government. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

--  I cannot understand the objections raised by the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  to the amendment, which provides that the federal executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia may place repatriation matters before the Minister. 

##### Mr Conelan:

--  Why should not other returned soldiers' organizations have a similar power? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- I see no reason why they should not have a similar power. 

##### Mr Blackburn:

--  Why name any particular organization? 

##### Mr FROST:

-- The honorable member for Melbourne  **(Mr. Calwell)**  saw merit in the proposal, but I see no reason why any organization should be specifically named. The amendment is superfluous. There is nothing to prevent other organizations from making representations to the Minister, who may refer the matters to the proposed committee. I cannot accept the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender).**  If an organization were formed it could make a request to the Minister, who, in turn, could refer it to the committee. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  That is not the issue. One of the functions of the committee will be to review war pensions. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- A request from the honorable member would be referred to the committee. 

##### Mr Spender:

--  A matter can be referred to the committee only by a resolution of the House. 

##### Mr FROST:

-- The honorable member is premature in making his suggestions. I do not see why a demand should be made, or a time limit should be fixed. 

##### Mr COLES:<br><small class="text-muted">Henty</small>

.- I accept the suggestions of the honorable member for Flinders  **(Mr. Ryan)**  and the honorable member for Bourke  **(Mr. Blackburn)**  and I ask leave to amend my proposed new clause as follows: -

##### Sir EARLE PAGE:<br><small class="text-muted">Cowper</small>

.- I desire to refer to the general principle that is being imported into the act. I favour the appointment of a repatriation committee, but the new proposal differs considerably from the original conception of the committee. The ultimate effect on the administration of the Repatriation Commission will be detrimental, and tedious delays will be created in dealing with many matters. It seems to me that the committee itself will tend to become almost a part of the administration. An exsoldiers' committee of members of this Parliament should be most elastic, ready to put up new ideas and to insist upon them being carried into effect. I fear that the difficulties that we are faced with at the present time, through everything being stereotyped, will be even more noticeable in the future than in the past. Therefore, although I am in favour of a committee which meets and discusses matters informally, I am altogether opposed to one which is brought into being in a  3ta.tut.ory  way. 

##### Mr SPOONER:<br><small class="text-muted">Robertson</small>

.- It is unfortunate that the speech of the right honorable member for Kooyong  **(.Mr. Menzies)**  has created an entirely wrong impression at this late stage of the discussion. The proposed committee, if constituted under the act in the form laid down, cannot interfere with the administration of the Repatriation Department. The Repatriation Commission has its powers under this legislation, and the all-party committee can do no more than consider the various matters of policy referred to it, from time to time, by either House of the Parliament, or by the Minister. It will have referred to it such matters as the quantum of pensions, and questions which will ultimately come to Parliament as matters of policy. The committee cannot interfere with the work of the Repatriation Commission. If that is so, how can we tolerate the Broadcasting Committee which has been functioning for some months? How can the honorable member for Parkes  **(Sir Charles Marr)**  reconcile his membership of that committee with his refusal to support the pro posed standing committee on repatriation on the ground that he does not agree with it in principle? I am perfectly clear upon the committee, and upon the way in which it will operate. It can only consider and report back to this Parliament upon specific matters of policy which are referred to it by either House of the Parliament or by the Minister, and cannot in any circumstances interfere with the administration of the department. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

--  I trust that the committee will dispose of these amendments as soon as possible. I am not attempting to coerce the committee, and, if honorable members wish to continue the debate, I am prepared to remain. 

Amendment of proposed new clause  **(Mr. Spender's)**  negatived. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:<br><small class="text-muted">Richmond</small>

.- I believe that the committee will not benefit the operation of the Repatriation Act, but the Minister  **(Mr. Frost)**  has said that he hopes that it is not going to be availed of to any great extent. 

##### Mr Frost:

--  I cannot see that it will be. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:

-- I wish to ensure as far as possible that it will not be used to a greater extent than is necessary, by placing some limitation upon the fees to be paid to the members of the committee. I find, upon examination of the records of some of the committees that have been appointed, that very large sums of money have been drawn in fees of £2 2s. a day, and I can see very little evidence of benefit a&amp; the result of that expenditure. In order to ensure that an undue amount of time will not be expended in following up various matters that might well be dealt with by the Minister himself, I move - 

  >That, after the proposed new section 56l, the following new section he inserted: - " 30m. The aggregate amount of travelling expenses payable to a member of the Committee shall not exceed fifty pounds in any one year."-. 

Amendment of proposed new clause  **(Mr. Anthony's)**  negatived.

New clause 39b  - 

##### Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES:<br><small class="text-muted">Wakefield</small>

-- Atthe request of the honorable member for New England  **(Mr. Abbott),**  I move - 

  >That, after clause 39a, the following new clause be inserted: - " 39B. After section fifty-seven a of the Principal Act the following section is inserted: -  57b. Rates of pension (other than service pension payable to a member of the Forces) and rates of prescribed periodical allowances shall be adjusted from time to time at intervals not exceeding six months (commencing with the half year ending on the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and fortythree), in accordance with variations in the cost of living, in such manner and subject to such conditions as are prescribed '.". 

In an earlier speech on the bill, I made a somewhat lengthy reference to this matter. I deeply regret that the honorable member for New England, who was prepared to speak upon it, has been obliged to leave Canberra. The object of the amendment is almost entirely to place war pensioners and their dependants in the same position as invalid and old-age pensioners in regard to increases of the cost of living. For some time, the cost of living has been rising. Due to the copious releases of credit which have recently taken place and are meditated in the future, it threatens to rise still higher. All of us recognize that war pensions are not in the nature of a charity. They are not even on the same basis as invalid and old-age pensions. The purpose is that they shall substantially compensate an injured returned soldier and his dependants for loss of health and in other ways on account of his war service. Although I opposed an increase beyond that of 20 per cent. which the Government placed before the committee, I am greatly concerned that there shall be no lowering of the value of the amount awarded to returned soldiers and their dependants as the result of a steep rise of the cost of living. The agreement which I made with the honorable member for New England was that the amendment should be so framed that it would provide for an increase or decrease of the rates of pension - other than the service pension, payable to a member of the forces, which is already provided for under another act - and of the rates of prescribed periodical allowances. These amounts will be adjusted according to increases or decreases of the cost of living. The amount received by the pensioner will be exactly calculated so as to ensure that it will at all times purchase the same quantity of goods. In that way, he will have real value because the purchasing value of his pension will remain constant, notwithstanding the upward or downward movement of the cost of living. This is somewhat different from the provision in relation to invalid and old-age pensions, in which case there is a flooring below which pensions cannot fall without the consent of this Parliament. I consider that the method which I now propose is the fairer. I cannot imagine that exception would be taken by any one to a variation of the amount received, corresponding with the rise or fall of the cost of living, so that the returned soldier and his dependants may continuously occupy the same position, irrespective of money  changes over which they have no control. I say emphatically that I do not believe in this principle as a general rule. If a fresh commencement had to be made, I should not be prepared to apply it to invalid and old-age pensions. But exservice men and their dependants are entitled to claim that we shall ensure that they will not be placed in an impossible position owing to variations of money values. In my opinion, no other section of the community has an equal claim. The amendment merely lays down the main principle, leaving the detailed arrangements to be covered by regulations. In the first instance, the Crown Law officers drew it in a form suitable for regulations to be incorporated in the act. Although the proposition may have considerable results under certain conditions, it is so simple that a returned soldier will be able to gather the gist of it from a cursory examination. The details, scientifically worked out, can be incorporated in regulations. 

I have much pleasure in moving the amendment on behalf of the honorable member for New England, and in heartily supporting it. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- The Government cannot accept the amendment. The honorable member for Wakefield  **(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)**  said that it was a simple provision, but it would create serious administrative difficulties. This proposed provision would be almost impossible to administer, because pensioners receive partial rate pensions, and the pensions of children and other dependants are involved. The calculations required to ascertain the increase in, say, the case of a child of a member whose pension is payable at the 10 per cent. rate, where the cost of living has risen1s. a week, would be difficult, and the increase, if any, would be almost negligible. All soldier organizations are known to be opposed to the principle of directly associating war pensions with the cost of living, and no recommendation for the introduction of the principle has ever been received. Immediately the cost of living fell, and  *a*  reduction was indicated, strong opposition would be met with from exservicemen's organizations, &amp;c. The work involved at each change would necessitate the whole staff of repatriation branch officers working day and night for a fortnight, during which period all other work would necessarily cease. This would result in delays, and hardship to claimants and appellants would follow. Other types of payments, such as medical sustenance, unemployment sustenance, educational allowances and living allowances bear some relation to war pensions, and increase one without increasing the other would cause misunderstanding. Such payments would have to be adjusted at the same time as pensions were adjusted in order to avoid anomalies. The different rates of war pensions, service pensions and prescribed allowances, either fixed or maximum rates, number well over 200. In very many cases the payments to a family consist of various kinds of pension or allowance. They consist of war pension and service pension ; war pension and fifth schedule amount; war pension and education allowance. The possible variations are numerous. With all this complex system of payments under the act and regulations, the department could not, without serious dislocation, undertake variation of amounts in accordance with price index numbers. 

New clause negatived.

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; Franklin &middot; ALP</small>

-- On this clause the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  had moved an amendment to extend the allowances to the widow and children for twelve months after the death of the soldier. The clause was postponed. Since then, the senior Ministers present discussed this amendment with the Repatriation Commission and with  **Sir Gilbert**  Dyett, federal  president  of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, before his departure for Melbourne this morning.  **Sir Gilbert**  has a close and intimate knowledge of the effect which failure to accept this proposal could have upon the widows, and after full discussion with him, the Goernment decided that it is justified in accepting the principle of the amendment, with the proviso that the period be limited to six months after the death of the soldier. Honorable members can rest assured that the Government is fully in sympathy with the principle of the amendment, but it is informed by its legal advisers that the amendment may have far-reaching implications in its present form. Therefore, the Government undertakes to move a suitable amendment in the Senate to give effect in principle to the proposal contained in the amendment. In the circumstances, I ask the honorable member for Parramatta to withdraw his amendment, and to accept the assurance I am giving on behalf of the Government. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">Moreton</small>

.- I understand that the honorable member for Parramatta  **(Sir Frederick Stewart)**  arranged with the Minister that the period of six months should date from the time of the notification of the death of the soldier. Otherwise, the provision might be of no benefit to the widows of many men who died in Malaya, because more than six months would have elapsed in their case before they received notification. 

##### Mr Frost:

-- I am prepared to agree to that. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:

-- On behalf of the honorable member for Parramatta, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

#### Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill - Discussion of Grievances

Mr.CURTIN (Fremantle- Prime Minister) [4.20] .   -  In moving - 

  >That the House do now adjourn, 

I express to honorable members the indebtedness of the Government for the way in which they have remained continuously at work in order to complete the consideration in this House of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill, so that the measure can be considered by the Senate at the commencement of its deliberations next week. This has been a long and difficult task, and I think thatit would be proper for me to say that all honorable members are indebted to the members of the special committee of parliamentary exservicemen for the work done by them. We are also grateful to the Minister for Repatriation  **(Mr. Frost),**  who, for nearly 26 hours, has sat continuously in charge of the bill. 

##### Mr CURTIN:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-A debate on the order of the day, Financial Statement - Motion for Printing of Paper - will enable honorable members to discuss general matters. As far as I know, the bills already on the notice-paper will have to be dealt with before the present sittings are concluded. Leave has already been given for the introduction of a bill to make provision for furlough for temporary employees in the Public Service who have had twenty years' service. A measure will be submitted to authorize an appropriation to enable the fertilizer bounty to be continued. I have also undertaken that time shall he given to the Leader ofthe Opposition  **(Mr. Fadden)**  to discuss the motion, of which  he has given notice, with regard to dairy products. I shall endeavour so to arrange the business of the House that the report of the Standing Orders Committee may be debated. In accordance with a statement that I made some time ago, a bill is to be introduced in the Senate by the appropriate Minister to provide that soldiers under the age of 21 years may become enrolled as voters, and so that those soldiers over 21 years of age who have neglected to enrol may not be deprived of their voting rights. That, I think, completes the list of measures that the Government desires the Parliament to deal with before it goes into recess. 

Question resolved in the affirmative.
