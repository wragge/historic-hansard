### QUESTION

#### INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION CONFERENCE

##### Mr JAMES:<br><small class="text-muted">HUNTER, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Will the Prime Minister state whether an international education conference is to be held in the United States of America next month? In view of the changes that are constantly taking place in education, and the dependence of a democracy on the maintenance of high educational standards for its survival, will the right honorable gentleman agree to the Government financing the attendance of representatives" of the Australian Teachers Federation at the forthcoming conference, as it does trade union delegates to conferences of the International Labour Office, as it is most desirable that Australia should be represented? 

##### Mr CHIFLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">Prime Minister &middot; MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- This proposal has been "the subject of discussion between the Australian Teachers. Federation, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and the Director of Education. It has been intimated to the Federation that, although the Commonwealth Government is willing to provide facilities for educational research or conferences, it it not prepared to make a direct contribution towards defraying the expenses of such gatherings. Australia was one of the first of the nations to accept the constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. I believe that a conference of that body is to be held next November. Australia will be properly represented at it. In the circumstances, the Commonwealth is not prepared to make a direct financial contribution of the kind suggested by the honorable member.

#### DAIRYING INDUSTRY

Drought Relief in Victoria. 

##### Mr McEWEN:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA</small>

-- Has the Minister forCommerce and Agriculture received any request or suggestion from the Government of Victoria for a review of the conditions under which drought relief from the funds jointly provided by the Commonwealth and the State of Victoria shall be made available to dairy-farmers in that State? 

##### Mr SCULLY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Commerce and Agriculture &middot; GWYDIR, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- I have no knowledge of any such communication having been received. I shall inquire in the department whether one has come to hand within the last few days, and shall reply to the honorable member later.

#### DUTCH SHIPS

##### Mr HOLT:<br><small class="text-muted">FAWKNER, VICTORIA</small>

-- Has the Minister for  the Navy and Acting Minister for External Affairs any information regarding the movement of the six Dutch vessels which are reported to have left Australian ports yesterday? Can the honorable gentleman say whether these vessels have sufficient fuel to reach their destination, and what action, if any, is being taken by the Commonwealth Government to ensure that they have the requisite fuel? 

##### Mr MAKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Aircraft Production &middot; HINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA &middot; ALP</small>

have received no intimation about the matter raised by the honorable member, but I feel sure that the ships would not have been despatched unless adequate fuel arrangements had been made. 

##### Mr FRANCIS:<br><small class="text-muted">MORETON, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Has the Minister seen a press report to the effect that several of Dutch ships which hadbeen held up in Australia for the last ten months, because of the refusal of waterside workers to load them, have left Australia? Was the Government advised of the projected departure of these vessels? Is it a fact, as reported, that the  *Bontikoe*  is being escorted to Java by the  *M anoora?*  If so, what is the reason? . Were the Dutch ships manned by Australian personnel; and if so were arrangements made by the Government for Australian seaman to be made available for this purpose? 

##### Mr MAKIN:

-- No official intimation has been received either by the Department of the Navy or the Department of 

External Affairs relative to the departure of Dutch vessels from Australia. The  *Manoora*  is taking certain Dutch nationals from this country to a point of disembarkation nominated by the Dutch authorities. Australian personnel are not manning any vesselsof Dutch origin. 

##### Mr Holt:

-- Navy personnel or civilian personnel? 

##### Mr MAKIN:

-- the best of my knowledge no Australians have been engaged for that purpose.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-4-0}
#### SHIPBUILDING

##### Mr RUSSELL:<br><small class="text-muted">GREY, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- Owingto the shortage of boiler-makers in South Australia who are free to take work at the Whyalla shipbuilding yards, and the danger to the ship production programme owing to the staff becoming unbalanced, can the Minister for Labour and National Service say whether theCommonwealth dilution scheme could be used to ease the shortage ? 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:<br><small class="text-muted">MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; FLP; ALP from 1936</small>

-- A few weeks ago there was much concern at Whyalla because of a shortage of boiler-makers. The point is, however, that there is no shortage in other parts of Australia, so we called a meeting of the Central Dilution Committee at which representatives of the central ship construction authority were present. I also was there, and we worked out a formula which provided that a number of men at Whyalla would be graded to enable them to carry out the duties of. boiler-makers in that district only, being registered as boiler makers on probation. Thus the ship building programme, which is a longrange one, has been safeguarded. The team now engaged at Whyalla is properly balanced, and the arrangement is satisfactory to the employers.

### QUESTION

#### FOOD FOR BRITAIN

Private Parcels


 **Sir FREDERICK** STEWART.Because of the prevailing rumours that many personal food parcels despatched from Australia are not reaching their destination in the United Kingdom, will the Minister for. Commerce and Agriculture make inquiries in order to learn what justification, if any, there is for the rumours? 

##### Mr SCULLY:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- As the result of a question asked by another member of the Opposition, I had a cable sent to the Australian Resident Minister in London asking him to inquire into the matter. The reply is not yet to hand.

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-6-0}
#### WHEAT INDUSTRY

Conditions in Stacks and Silos - Sales to Japanese - Registration of Growing Areas- United Kingdom Purchases from Canada. 

##### Mr BREEN:<br><small class="text-muted">CALARE, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture make a statement about the condition of wheat held in stacks and silos throughout Australia, stating particularly whether the wheat has been infected by mice? Can he say when the earlier wheat pools will be finally wound up? How much wheat from pools Nos. 1 and 2 was sold to the Japanese in 1941? How much did the Japanese contract to pay for the wheat, and has the purchase price yet been received? 

##### Mr SCULLY:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- Not long ago, I was advised by the Australian Wheat Board that the condition of wheat in stacks and silos was excellent. This information was confirmed when I made a personal inspection of the wheat during a tour through various parts of New South Wales. The condition of the wheat reflects credit upon the Wheat Board, and upon the agents who received the grain. As for the other matters raised by the honorable member, I shall have inquiries made, and supply the information later. 

##### Mr CLARK:<br><small class="text-muted">DARLING, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- In view of the necessity for obtaining maximum production of wheat, and the uncertainty that exists in relation to the registration of wheatgrowing areas, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture make a statement as to what steps should be taken by wheat-growers in order to be registered under the scheme, and what action they will have to take when the new proposals embodied in the bill now before the House become law ? 

##### Mr SCULLY:

-- At present growers may plant wheat without restriction. They may secure a temporary licence upon application to the local stabilization boards established in each of the States. Only a temporary licence may be issued at this stage because the whole of the Wheat Stabilization Regulations will disappear at the end of this year when the National Security Regulations expire. Future wheat registrations will be left in the hands of the States. In the complementary measures which  Ave  hope will be passed by the State Parliaments shortly, provision will be made for the establishment of State stabilization  committees  which will issue registration certificates to the wheat-growers. As the result of recent discussions of the Agricultural Council I am confident that the State stabilization committees will be representative of wheat-growers who will see that no injustice is done to intending growers or to those already established in the industry. 

##### Mr McEWEN:

-- Has the Minister for Commerce and- Agriculture any information which would enable him to confirm a report that has reached Australia in the last day or so, that an agreement between the Governments of Canada and the United Kingdom has been concluded or is on the point of conclusion, under which the Government of the United Kingdom will purchase its requirements of wheat from Canada for four or five years, at a price ' at Montreal that, is equivalent to 10s. Id. a bushel Australian currency for No. 1 grade Australian wheat? 

##### Mr SCULLY:

-- I shall have an inquiry made, and supply a full answer at a subsequent sitting. 

-- COMMUNIST PARTY. 

Activities in Canada and Australia. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">NEW ENGLAND, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Has the Acting Attorney-General seen a report in this morning's press giving extracts of the final report of the royal commission in Canada on Communist and Soviet activity in that country, wherein it is stated that communism in democratic countries changed long ago from a political party into a Soviet instrument for creating unrest and provocation? The report urges that Canada's security measures should be co-ordinated and strengthened to prevent agents from infiltrating into positions of trust in the Government. 

Has any action been taken by the Government to investigate communistic activities ih Australia? In view of the report of the Canadian royal commission, is any counter espionage work being carried out in Australia to circumvent the operations of enemy agents? 

##### Mr HOLLOWAY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Labour and National Service &middot; MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- L have not read the report to which the honorable gentleman has referred, but I shall read it with interest when I have an opportunity to do so. As the second part of the honorable member's question relates to a matter which cannot be suitably replied to offhand, I suggest that the honorable member should place that portion of the question on the notice-paper.

#### RABBIT SKINS

EXPORT Levy. 

##### Mr FRASER:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Trade and Customs &middot; EDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- There is still confusion in country districts about . the export levy on ,rabbit skins. Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say whether a local buyer of the skins has any authority to, show the amount of the export levy on his purchase docket and to deduct the amount of ls. 6d. from the amount that he previously agreed to pay to the seller? 

##### Mr SCULLY:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I say most emphatically that if the procedure outlined in the honorable gentleman's question has been adopted it is quite improper. No levy is imposed upon rabbit skins until they are at the point of export. Babbit skins are selling at phenomenal prices. At recent sales the price of 290d. per lb. was paid for first-grade skins. If those skins were for export a levy of ls. 6d. per lb. would have to be paid by .the exporter. Any person who acts in the manner implied in the question is fleecing the rabbit-trappers.

#### SUPERPHOSPHATE

Supplies from Nauru. 

##### Mr RANKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">BENDIGO, VICTORIA</small>

-- Has the Minister for  Commerce and Agriculture seen the statement of  **Mr. Bruce**  Shearer,  Chairman  of Directors of Australian Chemical Fertilizers and Sharby  Fertilizer Company Limited, that an early announcement would be made by the Government about shipments  *nf*  phosphatic  rock from 

Nauru ? Can be indicate what quantities of phosphates are likely to be made available to farmers this year and next year ? 

##### Mr SCULLY:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- A press announcement which will be made immediately will give the information required by the honorable member.

#### COAL-MINING INDUSTRY

Blair Athol Field

##### Mr CONELAN:<br><small class="text-muted">GRIFFITH, QUEENSLAND</small>

-- Has the Prime Minister seen the statement of the Premier of Queensland that while the Commonwealth is clamouring for coal there is enough coal at Blair Athol to last a century of two, and that he has written to the Commonwealth Government asking for co-operation with the State in the development of the coal? Has the right honorable gentleman any information upon this matter? 

##### Mr CHIFLEY:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- The working of coal measures in Queensland has been investigated by the Secondary Industries Commission, two members of which recently visited Queensland and had discussions with the Premier about the utilization of the deposits for local consumption or export. I understand that the proposal would involve the expenditure of a fairly considerable sum of money, because it would entail the construction of a railway line, better transport facilities, and, perhaps, loading equipment for ships. A proposal in regard to the utilization of the deposits will soon come up for consideration by the Government. I can give the honorable member no exact details at the moment.

#### RE-ESTABLISHMENT

Employment: Preference to ex-Servicemen. 

##### Mr SPENDER:<br><small class="text-muted">WARRINGAH, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Section 27 of the Re-establishment and Employment Act provides for preference in employment for ex-service men and women, but subsection 5 states that nothing in the section shall apply in relation to the engagement for employment- by an employer of a person who is already employed by him. I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction whether it is a fact that before positions in the Public Service are advertised in the press, people have already been temporarily appointed to them so that when the matter of a permanent appointment arises, the' act can be evaded or avoided by the person already temporarily engaged and employed by the Government in that position? In particular, I ask the Minister to inquire into certain positions advertised by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture for Trade Commissioners overseas. Were the provisions of the act avoided in the manner that I have described when the Government made those appointments? Will the honorable gentleman also inquire into appointments in the Department of External Affairs, and, indeed, in other Commonwealth departments, for the purpose of ensuring that the intentions of the act shall be observed? 

##### Mr DEDMAN:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Post-war Reconstruction &middot; CORIO, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- I shall make inquiries immediately and supply an answer.

#### GALVANIZED IRON, WIRE AND WIRE NETTING

##### Mr WILLIAMS:<br><small class="text-muted">ROBERTSON, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- Can the Minister for Works inform the House whether further quantities of galvanized wire netting, barbed wire and galvanized iron can be made available to farmers? Has the honorable gentleman read in the press a statement that enormous quantities of these materials are lying in Queensland, where they are awaiting distribution? Will he investigate the matter with a view to relievingthe urgent needs of farmers? 

##### Mr LAZZARINI:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Works and Housing &middot; WERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

-- I have not seen the report to which the honorable member referred, and I have no knowledge of large quantities of galvanized iron, barbed wire and wire netting being available in Queensland or elsewhere. I do not believe that the report is correct, but I shall make inquiries and advise the honorable member of the facts.

#### DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION

Questionnaire to Schools

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- Has the Minister for Information seen in the Melbourne  *Argus,*  the report relating to a questionnaire alleged to have been circulated by his department to headmasters of leading schools in Victoria to test the opinions of their young pupils ? Is ita fact that the questionnaire contained these questions - 

  >Do you think Australia should remain attached to the British Empire? 
  >
  >Do you think Australia should cultivate her relationship with America? 
  >
  >Do you think Australia should stand on her own feet as an independent country? 
  >
  >Have you a steady girl friend? 

The replies to the questions were to be. sent to America. I ask the Minister whether those questions were distributed to the schools, as stated in the report? Will he inform me what possible relation the fourth question has to the three preceding questions, or its value-- 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member is now inviting a debate and so spoiling a good question. 

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- What was the value of the fourth question, especially in view of the stated cost of the department, namely, £1,200 a day? 

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Immigration &middot; MELBOURNE, VICTORIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- I was rather amazed and confounded when my attention was first drawn to this matter. I could not believe that such a questionnaire could have been prepared by an officer of my department. Unfortunately, the fact is that such a questionnaire was prepared by a junior member of the staff, and circulated without reference to the Director-General of Information. When the DirectorGeneral ascertained that this action had been taken without any reference at all to any other officer, he immediately sent telegrams to the headmasters of the schools concerned,and told them to take no notice of the questionnaire. The  *Argus*  newspaper, which published this questionnaire, sent one of its reporters to see me, and when I declined to discuss the matter the honorable member for Wimmera was apparently requested to ask a question in the House. The questions included in the questionnaire gave me a good deal of concern. It is not the function of any officer of the Department of Information to question Australia's membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or to cast doubt upon it. Neither is it desirable to raise any doubt about whether we should have the closest association with the United States of America. I do not know where the question about the " steady girl friend " came from, and can only put it down to the youthf ulness of the officer concerned. I admit that an error was made. I have taken steps to see that it does not happen again. But if every error committed by a member of the  *Argus*  staff were elevated into a public or political issue, it would hasten the decline that is already noticeable in that once influential newspaper.

#### MATERNITY ACCOMMODATION IN HOSPITALS

##### Mr SHEEHY:<br><small class="text-muted">BOOTHBY, SOUTH AUSTRALIA</small>

-- I have received an invitation from the East Torrens County Board of Health to attend a meeting to discuss the shortage of maternity accommodation in hospitals. Can the Minister represening the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Services inform me whether there is any way by which the Commonwealth Government can assist the local health authorities in overcoming this shortage?

-- If the remedy involves the construction of new accommodation the problem is difficult. There is a problem all over Australia in relation to shortage of staff. In regard to new constructions, I repeat what the Prime Minister has said to Premiers conferences and also to honorable members when the Hospital Benefits Bill and the Tuberculosis Bill were before the House. The right honorable gentleman made it clear that whenever and whereever the States were able to undertake the construction of new accommodation the Commonwealth, would give such financial help as it could. I shall discuss with the Minister the particular question of affording help to the organization in the honorable member's electorate to which he referred, and ask him to give further information on the subject

#### THE PARLIAMENT

Broadcasting of Proceedings: Equipment - Report of Committee

##### Mr HUTCHINSON:<br><small class="text-muted">DEAKIN, VICTORIA</small>

-- I ask the Minister representing the PostmasterGeneral whether he will have a further investigation made of the quality of the instruments used for broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament, and also the general organization, having regard to the conditions in this connexion that exist in New Zealand ? I also ask whether it is correct that cardioid microphones are superior to others? If this is so, how many of these instruments are being used in this House? If they are npt being used extensively, why is this so? 

##### Mr CALWELL:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- I shall bring the honorable member's highly technical question to the notice of the PostmasterGeneral in order to see whether some action can be taken in the direction he desires. Parliament has been on the air for only a week or two, and the broadcasts are proceeding on a more or less trial and error basis. I have no doubt that, with experience, broadcasting on its mechanical side will improve. The information available to honorable members on the Government side of the chamber is that the public- generally appreciates what they are saying in the House. 

Later :

##### Mr SPEAKER (Hon J S Rosevear:<br><small class="text-muted">DALLEY, NEW SOUTH WALES</small>

-- As Chairman, I present the second report of the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Committee, which reads as follows - 

  >The Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings submits its Second Report for presentation to each House of the Parliament and recommends its adoption. 
  >
  >The Joint Committee" has further considered the general principles upon which there should be determined the days upon which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be broadcast, which were specified in its First Report adopted by both Houses on 5th July, 1940. In accordance with section 12 (1.) of the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 194B, the Joint Committee has now resolved - 
  >
  >That the following words be added to paragraph (2) of the general principles set out in its First Report: - "or at 11.30 p.m., whichever is the earlier ". (The paragraph would then read - " (2) Periods during which proceedings shall be broadcast: The broadcast shall commence on each sitting day at the time fixed for the meeting of the House whose opening proceedings are to be broadcast on that day as determined by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings in accordance with section 12 (2.) of the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1 940, and shall cease when the adjournment is moved in the House which is being broadcast at that time or at 11.30 p.m., whichever is the- earlier.".) 
  >
  >That the following paragraph be added to the general principles set out in its First Report: - "(C) The general principles specified in the First Report of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings adopted by both Houses on 5th July, 1946, shall be observed. generally by the Joint Committee in making determinations in accordance with the Parliamentary Proceedings .Broadcasting Act 1946 but nothing in those general -principles shall be taken to prevent the Joint Committee from departing from those general principles in order to meet any unusual or special circumstances." (Sgd.) J. S. Rosevear,  Chairman.  16th July, 1946. 

The recommendations now made are considered- by the committee to he necessary in order to modify certain provisions in the first report which, on review, were found to be somewhat rigid. Paragraph 2 of the First Report made it mandatory for the broadcast to continue until the adjournment is moved by a Minister. The committee examined the times at which the adjournment had been moved over a recent period of twelve months, and found that 47 per cent, of the motions had been made- before 10.30 p.m., 41 per cent, between 10.30 p.m, and 11.30 p.m., and 12 per cent, after 11.30 p.m. The committee also ascertained that the cost of extending the broadcast past 11.30 p.m., the time . at which the second national stations normally close down, would be approximately £50 an hour. It was considered that, even although the number of occasions on which the adjournment is .moved later than 11.30 p.m. is likely to be relatively small, the continuation of the broadcast to a late hour cannot, as a general practice, be justified. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that, unless unusual circumstances render an extension desirable, the broadcast should not continue past 11.30 p.m. The additional words and paragraph are designed to give effect to this recommendation and will also allow the committee to make such determinations as are deemed desirable in order to meet any unusual or unforseen circumstances which may arise. 

Motion (by  **Mr. Chifley)**  -  *by leave -*  agreed to -  y 

 That -the report he adopted.

-- The Connellan air service, as the Minister for Air knows, operates from Alice Springs and serves the whole of the Northern Territory. Is the honorable gentleman aware that his department has cancelled the licence of the aerodrome at Alice Springs known as the Town Site aerodrome, thus obliging this air service to operate from an aerodrome south of the Macdonnell Ranges, whichis most inconvenient to both the service and the people who use it? Is the honorable gentleman also aware that his department has indicated the probability of its cancelling the licences of a number of other aerodromes used by this service ? If he has no knowledge of the matter,' will he inquire into it, with a view to determining whether it is possible to make arrangements ensuring the continuance of this service, which has changed the whole of the conditions of life of very many people in the outback parts of 'the Northern Territory?

-- Beyond the fact that the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party mentioned this matter to me yesterday, I know nothing of the closing down of the aerodrome at Alice Springs.

I should not be willing to support the department if it did anything to interfere with the splendid service rendered in the Northern Territory by Connellan over a period of many years.

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- There is nothing so galling to a new member of this House than to have to listen, in the course of a debate such as this, to what some honorable member or party did for the wheat industry, ten, twenty, thirty, forty or fifty years ago. Such recapitulations of ancient history we had from the honorable member for Hume  **(Mr. Fuller),**  the honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard),**  and the honorable member forRiverina  **(Mr. Langtry).**  The honorable member for Riverina said that talk does not count, and I agree with him. There is an old saying " Talk is cheap but it takes money to buy land ". What honorable members opposite do not seem to realize is that it takes money, land, enterprise and energy to grow wheat, and that the man engaged in. the wheat-growing industry must be given at least as reasonable a deal as other members of the community. 

I strongly favour the stabilization of the Australian wheat industry, but I believe that any plan to that end must be on a basis that will sustain, maintain and be the means of developing this great asset of our Commonwealth. The bill before the House is not acceptable to me. As the representative of the most important wheat-growing constituency in the whole of Australia, I assure honorable members that more than 95 per cent, of the growers in that area are opposed to the bill in its present form. And that is but putting it mildly. We have been told by honorable members opposite that wheat-growers throughout the Commonwealth are fighting for it, but the truth is that its supporters are in the main the members of the Government and some of those on the payroll of the Government. The wheat farmers who favour the bill represent but a very small percentage of the farming community. The bill is but a reflection of the Minister's own preconceived ideas on the subject. I shall tell a story to illustrate my point. When I was a small boy I was taken to witness at a concert the performance of a great ventriloquist. We all were amazed at his wonderful skill at creating the illusion that his voice came from the far recesses of the stage. In the middle of the performance a great noise occurred at the back of the hall. It seemed as though a fight were in progress. Everyone turned round to look, only to discover "that it was only the ventriloquist. That is what is happening in connexion with this bill, which is nothing more than a reflection of the Minister's ideas. All through the Wimmera electorate the farmers are opposed to the scheme as propounded in this bill. I make that statement deliberately and I shall prove it up to. the hilt. During the campaign that preceded the by-election for the Wimmera seat at which I was the successful candidate, I was consistent in my opposition to this scheme, and the candidate who secured the next greatest number of votes also opposed it, especially the proposal to include the 1945-46 harvest in the plan. Yet on the first count five out of every six votes cast in that great wheatgrowing constituency were cast in our favour. Surelythat is sufficient proof  of the attitude of that great body of wheat-growers towards the measure. I have said that I favour the stabilization of the wheat industry. I do so, not only in the interests of the wheatgrowers themselves, but also because I believe that we should do everything possible to ensure that Australia may be in a  position  to. contribute the greatest quantity of wheat in order to feed the starving millions of the world. Honorable members opposite endeavour to create the impression that honorable members on this side of the House are opposed to a stabilization scheme. Nothing could Le farther from the truth. The stabilization of prices for primary products has always been the aim of the Australian Country party. My only regret is that certain provisions have been included in the bill and others have been omitted which preclude me from supporting the measure as it is now drafted. For that reason I give my whole-hearted support to the amendment which embodies all the conditions that are necessary to ensure that the industry will benefit and . that those engaged in it will receive justice. There is absolutely no reason to support the contention that the 1945-46 harvest, should be included in the scheme; but there are countless reasons of vital importance why it should be excluded. The wheat-growers, after years of drought, now, as perhaps never before, require capital to put in order their machinery - sheds, their houses, their fences, and even their personal belongings, and generally to equip themselves to produce this- most important food for the world's starving millions. The exclusion of the 1945-46 harvest from the scheme is of vital interest to individual growers; but there are interests deeper and more vital still. The whole future of the industry as Australia's second most important asset may be jeopardized. Furthermore, I contend, that the Government cannot justify the inclusion of last season's crop in a scheme which has not yet received the endorsement of this Parliament. The Government, however, seems to act on the misguided principle that might is r.ight We had a glaring example of the application of that principle in this Parliament prior to the introduction of the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Bill when on assembling here last month we were confronted by a forest of microphones installed in anticipation of the passage of that measure, showing definitely that the Government did not intend to bc influenced by any matters that might be revealed in  the debate on that bill. Now the Minister has said that the 1945-46 harvest will be included in the wheat stabilization plan, again showing this dictatorial attitude, an attitude that meets neither the demands of the democracy nor the approval of clear-thinking Australians. If the plan in its present form is adopted, the Australian wheat-growers will receive a lower net return than any commercial wheat-growers in the Englishspeaking world. The honorable member for Forrest  **(Mr. Lemmon)**  has apparently striven to confuse the issue. Speaking on this bill the honorable gentleman said - 

  >If such a scheme had been offered to growers within the last sixteen years it would have been grasped. 

How ridiculous is that. statement! Surely the honorable member must know that the rising costs of all those things that are necessary to primary production have made it increasingly essential to our future progress as a nation that those who produce the primary products must be on a satisfactory basis at least equal to that of other members of the community. What would have been a fair proposition in the past is now highly inadequate. Who among us would not like to purchase a suit of clothes, a motor car, cigarette papers, or a home at the level of supply and costs prevailing during the last sixteen years? Surely it is agreed by all that the present ' must be viewed in the light of existing circumstances, and what some former government did or what would have pleased the wheat-growers sixteen years ago, "like the flowers that bloom in the spring", has nothing to do with the case. Why hark back to the days of long ago? We must view the wheat industry in the light of the circumstances that prevail to-day, and not those that may have prevailed years ago. Going back into the past is useless. Conditions then were as different from what they are now as a 600-mile-an-hour aeroplane is different from a bullock dray and the cabbage-tree hats that were in use then. 

The inclusion of the 1945-46 crop in the scheme would be most unjust, because the crop has been acquired under the National Security (Wheat Acquisition) Regulations, and really cannot be included in this peace-time scheme, as the growers, having been led to believe that they would receive the full value of the crop, have entered into financial obligations with other members of the community that cannot be overlooked. The amendment provides for " a guaranteed price of not less than 5s. 2d. per bushel, bagged, basis at growers' sidings for the next crop ", which is an improvement on the bill, as "growers' sidings" is substituted for " f . o.r. ports ". It would not only give, the growers a more reasonable return but also be a step towards true decentralization. Only by a sound policy of decentralization shall we be able to maintain our present standard of living. No wonder the Premier of Victoria,  **Mr. Cain,**  said in Melbourne last Saturday - 

  >Melbourne is becoming too unwieldy. There cannot be a balanced economy until the population is more evenly distributed. 

No wonder, too, the Prime Minister said in this chamber during his financial statement - 

  >Production is the key to further relief from taxation. 

Those leaders know that, and it is clear that if we do not decentralize population we shall be heading for the greatest crash in our history. 

##### Mr Fuller:

-- That is what Opposition parties should have done years agowhen they had the opportunity. 

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- Back to the old days again! The key to prosperity is a return to the land. It is the only solution for this ill. Acceptance of the amendment by the Government would eventually do much to give us a balanced economy, and it would perhaps be the forerunner of a return to the days when primary production was unhampered and Australia's name rang throughout the world as the land of opportunity. Let us examine how " growers' sidings ", instead of " f . o.r. ports " would contribute towards decentralization. The man outback would he benefited. Why should not the man 300 miles from the port get as much for his wheat as the man 30 miles away? Men in the cities have too much advantage over the primary producers. For instance, a man in the Wimmera whose machine breaks down may need a duplicate part to put it in order. He rings up the distributor in Melbourne for it. It is not long before the telephone operator asks, "Do you want an extension ? " He takes it and probably before he has been able to order the part he has had two or three extensions, and the call costs him about 9s. A man in Melbourne in a similar plight merely rings up the local supplier for the part and the call cost him 2d. or less. 

##### Mr Archie Cameron:

-- And he can speak for as long as he likes. 

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- Yes. We must equalize things for men in the out-back if we are to decentralize industries and population, and if this country is to have a bright future. 

The amendment also provides for - 

{: type="a" start="b"}
0. an annual guaranteed minimum price related to cost of production; 
1. payment by the Government to the Aus tralian Wheat Board of the difference between the prevailing export parity and the price at which any wheat is sold by Government direction for export or consumption within Australia, other than human consumption within Australia; 
2. the establishment of an authority to ascertain current costs of production. 

It further provides that the price charged for wheat sold for human consumption in Australia shall be reviewed in the light of the change of costs and prices after the present price was fixed and that the stabilization plan should operate for ten years. The honorable member for Wakefield  **(Mr. Smith)**  assured us in his speech- 

  >The plan is not for one year but for five years. 

If it were for one year what would be its justification? The honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard)**  said that the producer must be placed on the same level as the labourer. Let us analyse that. A man has a basic wage of, say, £6 a week. That is the cost of the production of hisservices. What would henot say if some authority said to him, " You are to he paid £6 a week, but we will retain £2 of that amount to ensure that we shall be able to pay you £6 That is exactly what the Government proposes with respect to the wheat-grower. It says that he shall be given a certain amount of money for his wheat, but that approximately 33£ per cent, shall be retained to ensure that he shall get that amount of money. Never was there anything so unfair as that. It must be put right. 

I intend to deal further with- this matter in committee, but, before closing, I desire to make reference to the provisions of the bill. Let us consider clause 6 (1.) - 

  >The Board may- appoint any number of its members to be an Executive Committee and delegate to that Committee such of its powers and functions as the Board; subject to any direction by the Minister, determines. 

That looks like dictatorship by the Minister. Let us follow it on to clause 7(3.)- 

  >The members of each Committee shall be appointed by the Minister and shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister. 

That also -savours of dictatorship. "Will these committees be formed from departmental officers, businessmen, growers representatives or other government nominees? I move oil to clause 10 (2.) - 

  >The Board shall have and perform all the duties, and shall have and may exercise, in relation to the wheat harvested in any wheat season up to and including the 1045-40 season, all the powers. 

That may mean that the old board will not necessarily complete any of the pools or any of its duties. Does this indicate a method of stopping legal action for compensation in regard to any pool that has not been completed and that all pools will  be brought  under the new law? It looks like that to me. It seems that the producer will have no means of getting a just payment from the pools of the past that should be completed now. Many of them should have -been determined long ago. The growers are calling for finality now. Clause 11 provides - 

  >Subject to this Act, the National Security (Wheat Acquisition) Regulations shall, by force of this Act, in so far as they relate to wheat harvested in any wheat season up to and including the 1945-40 season, continue in force until such date as is fixed by Proclamation, and shall, during such continuance, have the force of law. 

Under clause 10 the word "purchase" probably means a definite contract by which the grower is debarred,  from objecting  to any price, be it fair or not. The bill contains many provisions that are not in the interests of the producers. Here is the most glaring. Clause 21 provides - (1.) For the purposes of this Act there shall be a Wheat Industry Stabilization Board. (2.) The Stabilization Board shall consist of- 

{: type="a" start="a"}
0. a Chairman, an executive member and one other . member each of whom shall be appointed by, and  shall hold office during the pleasure of, the Minister; and 

    {: type="1" start="6"}
    0. one member appointed by the Minister to represent each State after nomination by the appropriate Minister of State of that State. 


I point out that the Stabilization Board has full power to curtail production, if at any time the Treasury is likely to be required to provide money in order to ' bolster the price of wheat. Therefore, the plan is not in  the  best interests of wheat-growers or Australia as a whole, and I support the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Indi. The bill must be redrafted before we shall obtain justice for the man on the land. 

A large majority of wheat-growers are opposed to this plan. That is well known. I invited the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to visit the great wheatgrowing electorate of "Wimmera in order to obtain a proper appreciation of the opposition to his proposals. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- The wheat-growers in the Wimmera have always given me a warm welcome. 

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- Because they have a personal regard for the honorable gentleman, they will give him a warm welcome; but they do not welcome his plan. Whilst I appreciate the assistance that the honorable gentleman has given to me since I became a member of this Parliament, I must voice  the hostility of wheat-growers to this bill. I propose to read extracts from the report published by the Warracknabeal  *Herald*  of a meeting of wheat-growers which considered the stabilization plan. Many centres were represented, including St. Arnaud, Wycheproof, Marnoo, Beulah, Dimboola and Horsham. The report "will convey to supporters of the bill the strong, feeling in the Wimmera and Mallee against the plan. The heading over the report appears in large black type - " Wheat Stabilization Scheme - Opposition to the Federal Plan ", and the introductory passage reads - 

  >Declaring  that it might be described as a stop-work meeting of wheat-growers of Victoria, Cr. S. J. King (Warracknabeal), who. presided at the largely attended gathering of farmers of this portion of the north-west at the Warracknabeal Town Hall on Thursday afternoon, May 23, said that it was pleasing to see so many men who were vitally concerned with the stabilization of the wheat industry. 

All wheat-growers who attended that meeting are in favour of stabilization, but they are opposed to the present scheme. One of the speakers was  **Mr. A.**  0. B. Shannon, who has been associated with the growing of wheat and other cereals for many years.  His  parents came from South Australia and were pioneers in- the industry. The report of his remarks reads - 

  >Growers were the ones vitally concerned with the stabilization question,  **Mr. Shannon**  continued. Personally he had stuck out solidly for 5s. 2d. per bushel f.o.r. country sidings as a first advance. This was below present world prices, but he considered it a fair price. Just now growers were concerned about securing the greatest return possible for their product. Many had continued to y;row wheat at an unprofitable price, but had stuck to it in the knowledge that the world wanted wheat desperately and were prepared to do their part in supplying that need. 


 **Mr. Gi** G.. McGregor, of Callawadda, who is well known throughout the Wimmera  - 

  >Spoke vigorously against the proposed stabilization plan, contending that 5s. 2d. per bushel f.o.r. was not sufficient. The wheatindustry was now at the cross roads and he saw grave danger in growers agreeing to accept any price that was not guaranteed  above  the cost of production, plus a reasonable margin of profit. 


 **Mr. Hines,** of Marnoo, a well.known Victorian producer also is reported to Iia ve ; 

Expressed the opinion that one of the burning questions to consider was that of whether the 1945-46 harvest should be included in the stabilization plan. 

The speakers at that meeting, who did not hesitate forcefully to express their views, are solidly behind the principle of stabilization. Honorable members opposite who declare that those wheatgrowers are opposed to stabilization are only trying to confuse the issue. The fathers of these growers pioneered this industry, which has helped to promote the prosperity of Australia. To-day, the sons are carrying on, despite drought and other adverse conditions. The report of  **Mr.**  Hines's  remarks continued - 

  >He opposed this and was also solidly against the plan, which in his opinion proposed to take away, the birthright of the wheat-grower. He did not favour growing wheat and handing it over to the Government- at the _price they proposed to advance. 

Those' passages, which I have read, reflect the hostile feeling of the meeting towards the plan. Only three spoke in favour of it. During the main supporting speech, a steady moan could be heard throughout the assembly, and this  speaker  was the only one to whom the meeting refused to grant an extension of time. When the motion that he be. granted an extension was put the " Noes " resounded and echoed throughout the hall. After further discussion,  **Mr. J.**  Feeny,  of St. Arnaud, submitted an amendment - 

  >That the meeting refuse to accept anything less than was asked for by the Wheat Growers Federation at the Perth conference. 

With the consent of honorable members, I shall incorporate in  *Ilansard*  the decisions of that conference-^ 

{: type="a" start="a"}
0. Thai the Federal Government be requested to se_t ,up a commission of inquiry on which wheat-growers- should have adequate representation, to ascertain the cost of producing a bushel of wheat, the guaranteed floor price to be the cost of production as determined by the commission with provision for a review every year to relate the price to any rise or fall in the cost of production. 

    {: type="1" start="6"}
    0. That in view of the legal doubt that the 1945-46 harvest being acquired under National Security (War-time) Regulations cannot be included in the peace-time plan, this crop be excluded. 

1. That the federation request that the 1945-46 harvest be not included in the plan as it had been acquired under National Security (War-time) Regulations. 
2. That pending the setting up of the commission of inquiry to ascertain the guaranteed floor price, the 5s. 2d. be accepted as a first advance payment only;- that any difference between the 5s. 2d. f.o.r. as a first advance payment and the determined guaranteed floor price as found by the commission be made up by retrospective payments to the guaranteed floor price. 
3. That the reserve fund be controlled by trustees appointed by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and the Australian Wheat Board and invested to earn current interest rates. 
4. That when the export price exceeds the determined price, 50 per cent, be paid to the reserve fund to be drawn upon when prices recede below the guaranteed floor price; the balance of 50 per cent, to be paid in cash to the grower; any deficiency in the reserve fund to be made up of a grant from the Treasury. 
5. That the Federal Government be requested to introduce legislation with the object of giving the Australian Wheat Board the necessary statutory powers to assume full control of the production, acquisition, care, sale, distribution and export in conjunction with the Wheat Stabilization Board, and the financing of Australian wheat, together with power under the authority of the Common- ' wealth Treasurer to negotiate the necessary advances direct with the Commonwealth Bank. 
6. That a system of wheat licensing and farm registration be included in the plan under the control of a wheat stabilization board. 
7. That production be not restricted below a basis that will permit a minimum of 90,000,000 bushels for export. (j)That the plan operate for a period of not less than ten years. 

Those decisions were in conformity with the object of the amendment which I am supporting. Meetings have been held throughout the Wimmera district to protest against the stabilization scheme, and, as the representative of that electorate, I should fail in my duty if I did not voice strongly that opposition. The wheat-growers of the Wimmera are concerned about what will happen to the fund if the stabilization scheme should be discontinued. We know what is happening at present in regard to funds that have accumulated from the sale of wool. More than £7,000,000 has accrued in profits from the sale of wool. The woolgrowers desire to know whether they will receive the whole or even a part of this money, to which I believe, as I observed during question time yesterday, they are fully entitled. Asimilar accumulation of funds may occur in the wheat stabilization fund. If so, will the money be distributed to the growers or will it be paid to other persons in the community who may have had nothing to do with the growing of the wheat? What will be the position of the wheat-grower who, through no fault of his own, has to withdraw from the industry after some years of association with it? Is he to lose one-third of his earnings which may be held in the stabilization fund? These points do not appear to be dealt with in the bill. What will be the position of the man who is operating on a temporary permit and whose permit may be cancelled? Ishe to lose his right to the proportion of his earnings that is being held in the fund. Surely he is entitled to his equity. The Minister has not made these points clear, and we are entitled to information upon them. I am definitely opposed to the Government's stabilization scheme in its present form. I have always favoured stabilization, and I favour it to-day, but it must be on right lines. At the committee stage I shall refer to many other anomalies in the bill which should not be accepted by honorable members. The only means we have of assuring our future progress is by decentralization through the provision of better conditions for primary producers. True prosperity in this country when it comes will come through the sheep runs and the golden harvest fields. 

Mr.BREEN (Calare) [3.54].- The plan which the Government is proposing in this measure for the stabilization of the wheat industry for a period of at least five years is, in my opinion, practicable. In principle it is accepted even by those who, for political purposes, are trying to work up hysteria among certain sections of the community against the Government. The rival scheme proposed in the amendment of the honorable member for Indi  **(Mr. McEwen)**  would undoubtedly be good if the Commonwealth Government and the people of Australia could fairly be called upon to guarantee the fund by the making of inordinate contributions from public revenues. I propose to address myself chiefly to the points of difference between the scheme of the bill and that of the amendment. Both schemes rest on the common ground that the wheat industry cannot stand on its own feet in Australia or anywhere else in the world, and that stabilization depends upon international agreements and organization in exporting countries of schemes which can be  dovetailed one into the other. Only by  that  means can prosperity be guaranteed to those who produce the food of the world. Food production has exercised the minds of members of governments from time immemorial. Even in the days of Livy, Cicero and- Caesar, corn was regarded as a munition of war, and it was recognized that one .way to stabilize the affairs of the nation, and to- discourage people from developing revolutionary activities, was to ensure an adequate supply of food. It was appreciated that if people were well fed . they would be less likely to listen to the  fulminations  of agitators against existing governments than they would if they were ill.-fed. 

The main questions at issue between the Government and the Opposition are. first, whether the 3945-46 harvest should be included in the stabilization scheme; and, secondly,- whether the guaranteed price should be foi- a longer period than five years. The Government has had to consider whether it would- be giving undue consideration to one section of the community as against another section if it did not insist that advantage be taken of the high price temporarily ruling overseas for wheat, in order to assist to ensure the payment, of the guaranteed minimum price for the five-year period. T do not believe that any economist or any other reasonable person, howover rabid he might be in his claim for consideration for the wheat-growers, could do other than admit that the high prices now ruling for wheat in America, and also in certain other overseas countries, as against the fixed price in Australia, are due to the fact that in those other countries there is no price-fixing structure. It must be remembered, also, that the wheat-growers in Australia, who are also consumers of wheat, are  receiviug  the advantages of our economic structure in relation to wage-pegging, the control of interest rates, and the keeping clown of transport costs. All these factors are important considerations in determining  the cost of producing wheat in Australia. It would be unfair to permit one section of the community to obtain that advantage without having to supply a proportion of its production to others who had helped to make it possible. Those who have the benefit of having their views expressed in  *The Land,*  the newspaper owned by the Farmers and Settlers Association, .are strongly opposing this scheme, in my opinion purely for political purposes, and. have proposed as an alternative that the 1945-46 harvest should be completely excluded from it, the wheat-grower to have the advantage of a hardandfast cost, structure in Australia and at the same time to benefit from the price fixed on chaotic inflationary conditions overseas. In order, to show that those who contribute articles to the journal I have mentioned can " see the light " from time  to time, even though their employers are politically prejudiced, I quote this leading article which was published in  *The Land*  on the 12th July - ' 

Hie world demand for wool may be only one factor in causing a big rise in prices and it may be the least important one. The main l en son may be the degree of inflation existing in many other countries. If great increases duc to depreciated currencies overseas are to  be  reflected in fantastic prices for our wool mid other export commodities then it will bc more  difficult  than ever to prevent a higher degree of inflation in this country with its accompanying fall in the value of the Australian fi. 

As a factor in establishing overseas credits, wool is more vital than wheat to Australia. If the argument  of  *The Land*  be logical in regard- to wool, is it not equally logical in regard to wheat? I have said that the Australian wheat producer is also a wheat consumer in certain circumstances: In this farflung land of ours, "Western Australia may have a bounteous harvest, and simultaneously New South "Wales may experience drought conditions, as is the case at the present time, the wheat crop prospects not being good. If there were no control, the wheat-producers in Western Australia would reap an advantage from the high prices ruling overseas, but only for the time being. ' What position would arise when the wheat-grower in New South Wales, who has become accustomed to feeding his stock on wheat, had to purchase his requirements at the prevailing high prices? In order to substantiate my statement that the wheat-grower is also, at times, a consumer of wheat, I shall cite a few statistics from the return by the Wheat Industry Stabilization Committee in New South Wales as at the 31st May,  wheat. Without some control, and a stabilization scheme backed by the Government, which will ensure that the price will, not fall below a fixed minimum, there is chaos following a good harvest. That is another reason for the whole-  hearted support of this scheme by the wheat-farmers in my electorate. The political hysteria that has been worked 

One matter needs a little consideration by the House; that is, whether the .wheat-grower should be in complete control of wheat marketing schemes. If this were merely an equalization scheme; if the surplus receipts were placed in a pool, and were disbursed among the wheat-growers when the price of wheat was low, then they would be entitled to complete control. But if such an arrangement were practicable, the wheat-grower would not need to ask the Government for assistance in organizing the marketing of his product, because that could be done by his co-operative organizations. Honorable members of this House" know that, having regard to the cost of production, a sufficient price cannot be guaranteed without a background of Government finance. If the Government has to guarantee a minimum price, irrespective of whether or not there is enough money in the pool to meet the guarantee, it is entitled to be represented on any body which controls the scheme. As the Government advances public funds, it is entitled to. have some voice in the disbursement of them. If this scheme- is handled properly, and many of the abuses that have occurred in the past are eliminated, there will not be much need for 

Government assistance. Having studied some actuarial calculations, I was inclined to the belief that a minimum guarantee of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. might oblige the Government to provide a substantia'! amount, having regard to the past history of the wheat industry. But I have before me rather illuminating figures which have been taken out by  **Mr. 0.**  T. Chapman,  president  of the South Australian  Wheat Growers Association. He has taken a period of 21 years, but I shall deal only with the period from 1929-30 to 1942-43, in which the price fluctuated by as much as 3s. dr 4s. a bushel. Over that period of ten years, if an equalization scheme only had been operating, the wheat-farmer in South Australia would have received 4s. 6£d. a bushel for his wheat at Moonta siding. With such a background, it could be argued that the Government might not need to underpin the scheme by providing government finance for the next five years. If this scheme is to be financed for only five years there is nothing wrong with the wheat-farmer who produced for the 1945- 46 harvest foregoing some of what he would have received, seeing that the price that he will get per bushel for what he produced in the 1945-46 harvest will be far above the cost of production, even  03i  the assumption that it was much higher in that year than it had been in any previous period. As against this, the question is asked : What will be the position of a farmer who was in production at that time, and now wishes to sell his property? What is to happen to his equity? I remind honor-, able members that much thought has been given to the rehabilitation of exservicemen. Because they were in the armed forces it was not possible for them to have been producing wheat during the period from 1942 to 1945. If the Government had hesitated to throw everything into the defence of Australia, it is doubtful whether the farmer who had. a good harvest in 1945-46. would have got the benefit of it. Some one else might have gathered that harvest. The fighting men of Australia are primarily responsible for the preservation of Australia from its  enemies,  but, as I have said, they were not able to grow crops during the period from 1942 to 1945. thus, the farmer who was able to carry on during that time, while others were away fighting for him, will be making a comparatively small contribution under this scheme to the post-war stability of the ex-serviceman who goes on the land and raises crops from now on. The asset of the farmer who remained on his land has been enhanced in value as a consequence of the sacrifices of ex-servicemen, and it is those ex-servicemen whom we must consider during the next four or five- years. I have a poor opinion of the patriotism of anyone who is not prepared to do what is necessary to guarantee the economic stability of ex-servicemen in the time ahead. 

I confess that the figures which I have cited astonish me. I believed that, over the period under review, the arrangement for price equalization would not meet the situation, and that the scheme would have to be buttressed by a Government contribution. But that may not be necessary. In the past, the average wheat-grower lived from year to year. Even with the assistance of co-operative organizations, growers were generally unable to hold ' their wheat for two or three years. They had to sell immediately the wheat wa.= harvested, with disastrous results to themselves. However, with a Government guarantee, an equalization scheme must be successful.' 

We must' also give attention to methods of preserving stored wheat from . injury. Conditions during the next four or five years will be very much the same as those which prevailed immediately after the last war. Honorable members will recall the .big harvest after the last war, and the drought which followed. They will also recall scandals associated with the disposal of second-grade wheat, and wheat damaged by mice. The British Government had acquired a part of the Australian crop, and it sent, Professor Lefroy to Australia to investigate the situation. At that time, there were no silos for storing wheat, and it was necessary to stack in bags. Discussing the situation as it then existed, Professor Lefroy said - 

  >The sound policy for Australia is to cultivate as large a stock of wheat as possible. There will bc a terrific food shortage after the war. 

How well .that could be said of the situation which exists to-day. The professor went on - 

  >Wheat can be saved from  weavil.  Stored, as 1 suggest, your wheat will keep indefinitely - 1 will guarantee five years at least. 

It is still possible to preserve bagged wheat for at least five years. Conditions are much the same now as after the last war, and they should produce the same result, so let us be guided by what happened then. We should guarantee to the grower a f air return for his labour, while still ensuring that the people will get their food at a price which they are able to pay. That is of fundamental importance. If food is npt made available to the consumers at a price  which  they can 'pay it follows axiomatically that the wheatgrowers themselves cannot be prosperous. 

Various commissions have been appointed to find out the cost of producing wheat.. The Gepp Commission made an exhaustive inquiry into all' phases of the industry, an4 arrived at a figure based upon an average of the costs on a limited number of farms. I suggest, however, that such a system cannot produce satisfactory results if there is. a big diversity of costs on the farms under consideration. In the electorate of the honorable member for Indi  **(Mr. McEwen),**  I have seen men trying to grow wheat on irrigated land. The cost of producing wheat under such conditions could not be less than £l a bushel, and such a result should not be taken into consideration when assessing the average cost of production. There are areas in New South Wales where it would cost 10s. a bushel to grow wheat, whilst there are others in which the cost would not be more than 2s. 6d., provided the farmer has been on his land for years, and holds it free of debt. Of course, if a farmer, even in the same area, bought his land during recent years at £14 or £15 an acre, he could not possibly grow wheat at 2s. 6d. a bushel. In arriving at a fair figure for the cos.t of producing wheat we .should consider the cost on a fair, average sample of Australian land the capital value of which is reasonable. No good result would be achieved by trying to strike an average over the last 50 years, during which prices were sometimes high and sometimes low. It is also necessary to consider whether ; the farmer's position is financially sound, or whether he has to pay out too great a part of his returns as interest on borrowed money. The Gepp Commission found that the two principal items in the cost of production were labour and interest. Interest charges have been considerably reduced because of the operations of the Commonwealth Bank. When farmers .had to go to private banks for overdrafts, the rate of interest varied considerably as between one borrower and another, depending upon the bank manager's idea of the applicant as a business risk. For instance,- one-man might have to pay 6i per cent, on his overdraft, whilst another might get money at 4£- per cent. It will be seen how this factor alone could seriously affect the cost of production as between one farm and another, even though the land might be similar, and both farmers received the same price for their crops. Since the Commonwealth Bank has -gone into, active competition  with the private banks, and since interest rates have been under the control of the Prices Commission, there has been a general decline of overdraft rates of interest. At the present time, the average overdraft rate in the wheat belt is no more than 4 per cent, whereas, in 1939-1940, it was between 6 per cent, and 7 per cent. This reduction is one result of the increased trading activity of the Commonwealth Bank and of the financial policy of the Labour Government. 

The other important factor in the cost of producing wheat is the cost of labour. The average family of men on the land is larger than the average family in the city. In urban areas, the average family is a man, his wife, and one and a half children, whereas in rural areas it is a man, his wife, and three children. When the children of the farmer grow up, unless they leave the district to seek jobs elsewhere, they must be kept by him, and the cost of maintaining them must ultimately be added to the cost of producing wheat, because their labour is used in the working of the farm. Tractors were not used extensively on farms at the time the Gepp Commission made its report. Indeed, the commission reported that it had considered the incidence of power farming, and had found that many farmers had abandoned tractors and gone back to horses. The commission could not say whether it was more advantageous to use tractors or horses. At the present time, however, there is a tremendous demand for tractors, which have revolutionized wheat-growing. We have learned much from the Americans during the war about the mechanization of farming operations. To-day, the farmer realizes that he is " not in the hunt " if he has to depend on horses. Because of the vagaries of the weather, it is sometimes necessary that a farmer should work 24 hours a_ day in order to sow his crop or harvest it. This, can be done with tractors, but not with horses. A tractor for use on a single-unit farm may cost £800 or £900, and its use does away with the need for much labour. Thus, unless mixed farming is indulged in, there is little for the members of the farmer's family to do, and the cost of their upkeep must be added to the cost of the tractor, and so to the cost of producing wheat. We must take into consideration the fact that, unless something can be done in the way of establishing industries in country towns to provide employment for the members of farmers' families, the young people will either drift to the metropolis and be engulfed there, or their upkeep must become a charge against the products of the land. 

In the future, when the demand for wheat lessens, it may be necessary to limit production arbitrarily on certain kinds of land. . Either an arbitrary rule will have to be made under which, say, " A " is given a licence to sow 250 acres and " B " a licence to sow 200 acres, and the rest of their properties is eliminated, although it might be very good wheat land, or a guaranteed minimum price will have to be fixed at such a rate as to eliminate wheat-growing in all areas where a good crop cannot be harvested under all. conditions. Because of the diversity of methods of production' and of the great number of unknown factors I do not favour the application of such an arbitrary rule. Again, if a farmer is not properly financed he may be forced out of production, even though he may be farming the best wheat land in the country. Such a farmer would not be able to grow wheat again. 

The honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron)**  dealt with the aspect of international agreements at some length last night, and, having given the subject some intense study lately I was naturally interested -in what he had to say. International agreements for wheat production and marketing will not be of much use  unless all signatory countries are prepared to honour the spirit as well as the letter of the agreement. From time to time over the last 20 or 30 years conferences of representatives of wheat importing and exporting countries have been held in an endeavour to devise a scheme that would obviate violent fluctuations of the price of the world's principal foodstuff. Through failure in the past to get an international agreement, European economy has been inclined to develop a European hegemony under which the Danubian countries would supply wheat to importing countries .such, as Italy, France and the other western nations of Europe. That move, however, failed because of national disagreements and the  consistent endeavour of one- country to obtain an advantage over another.- When war was imminent we had the spectacle of the United Kingdom subsidizing wheatfarmers to produce wheat at a price which could not compete against imports from other countries more suitable to wheat production. France, Germany and Italy did likewise. Then, the great wheat exporting countries of the Balkans were left with surpluses which were debarred from entering other countries because of their fiscal policies. These surpluses were thrown on the markets of the world where they came into competition with wheat exported from Canada, Australia and the United States of America. The industry suffered a great slump, and many wheatfarmers were quickly forced out of production. Countries which had large surpluses of wheat were not in a position to . guard the grain against deterioration, and so huge quantities were wasted. Yet within two years the world was starving for wheat and once again wheat-growers in all countries rushed into production. Unless the wheat exporting countries are prepared, to settle their differences and honour the spirit as well as the letter of international agreements respecting the disposal of the world's wheat harvests, anything that we do in this country to stabilize the wheat industry will not be effective because we have not the wealth to subsidize exports. If, in order to obtain overseas funds we subsidize our wheat exporters, it would have to be done at the expense of some other section of the community. Australia is in a very favorable position with regard to its wool exports, . because it has almost a world monopoly of wool of the merino type. "Without our merino wools the markets of the world would be short-supplied. But even if we failed to market a bushel of Australian wheat overseas it is more than likely that in normal conditions the world would be well fed. Accordingly, it might not be to our interest to subsidize wheat exports in order to obtain overseas credits. It might be far better to abandon any thought of exporting wheat and to concentrate on growing sufficient for home consumption and stock feed, and to convert much of our wheatlands into cattle or sheep raising areas. The Gepp Commission in its conclusions on the wheat industry said - 

  >The wheat industry has an undoubted claim to assistance from the community. This claim  is the greater because - 
  >
  >the industry probably provides more direct employment than any other single industry in Australia; 
  >
  >the industry provides almost 20 per cent, of the freight earnings of, and approximately the same percentage of the total tonnage of goods carried by the railways of the four principal wheat-producing States; 
  >
  >numerous towns and townships throughout the four principal wheat-producing States are dependent in a larger or smaller degree upon the industry for their existence; (&lt;{) the industry contributes a substantial proportion of Australian credits overseas; " 
  >
  >13,622,358 of the 23,978,157 tons of cargo shipped from Australian ports in the period from 1927-28 to 1931- 32 was provided by the wheat industry. 

This question of the stabilization of the wheat industry in Australia is not merely a matter of resolving what is right and just for the farmer and fair to the consumer, but is also vital to our national economy, and every section of the community must accordingly be greatly interested in it. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">New England</small>

--  The bill before the House represents only a portion of the plan to stabilize the wheat industry. A part of the plan is to be put into effect by the Commonwealth and the remainder by the States. We are placed at a great disadvantage in not having full details of the complete scheme before us. Until we are given the details of that portion of the plan that will be operated by the States we cannot gain a complete picture of the scheme or judge of its efficacy or otherwise to meet the"  problems of the wheat-growers. It has been stated by Government spokesmen that the joint proposals of the States and the Commonwealth will bring about the stabilization of the wheat industry. I believe, however, that the wheat-growers of Australia will' get the greatest shook they have ever experienced when this plan has been in operation for a little while, because it cannot, as it is, bring about the desired result. It - is all very, well to talk about a stabilized price and say that certain  action will be taken by the State parliaments to give effect to the scheme. We should have the fullest details of the scheme as a whole. The Minister's secondreading" speech on this bill was the most timid and hesitant statement I have ever heard on such an important subject. No less than eight times during the course of his speech the honorable gentleman referred to regulation of production. Knowing the world position to-day with its starving millions in Europe who are crying out for our wheat, the honorable gentleman felt impelled to apologize for referring so frequently to the regulation of production. It is all very well for the Government to guarantee a price to the wheat-grower, but if at the same time it decides to cut down his production how can he benefit? This scheme provides no guarantee of stabilization for the wheat industry. I am opposed to the scheme because - (a) it limits the. acreage to be grown in the Commonwealth; (6) it restricts production only to those now licensed; (c) it makes no provision for the granting of licences to exservicemen settlers;  *(d)*  it envisages regulation of production of all wheat-growers under certain economic conditions, irrespective  of the amount of wheat they produce; and (e) it will deprive the grower of 50 per cent, of the value of his export wheat when it is above 5s. 2d. a bushel and 100 per cent, of all wheat above 5s. 2d. which is consumed within Australia. As has been pointed out by the honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron)**  this proposal constitutes, in effect, a direct tax on the wheat-growers of Australia. It goes farther than that; it constitutes a tax on gross income. In normal taxing measures the impost is on net incomes arrived at after certain deductions have been allowed. Under this proposal, however, the wheat-growers of Australia will be taxed not on the net. incomes from production, but on the gross production from their farms. Finally, I am opposed to the scheme because it makes provision for the regulation of production even within the five-year period during which it is to operate. The Minister has said that the wheat-grower will know that his -industry is stabilized for five years and that he will have a guaranteed price for that period ; but the grower will be by no means certain that he will get his expected return from his farm, because, apart from 'the vagaries of weather conditions, if the world situation in wheat changes his production will be cut down. Thus, he may never receive the return he might reasonably have expected to obtain from his property. . 

##### Mr Scully:

-- But for the scheme the price of wheat would fall if it were not guaranteed. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- -If the .price were guaranteed and production were not cut ' down that would constitute real stabilization; but if the wheat-growers' production is cut down substantially the scheme is worthless. 

##### Mr Burke:

-- The honorable member knows that the bill provides that wheatgrowers' production may not be cut down below his basic acreage. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- The Minister's speech quite clearly indicated that it could be regulated to any point. The honorable gentleman also said that the price that will be guaranteed for wheat grown in Australia must be a price closely approximating that prevailing in the export markets of the world. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- Is not the price definitely guaranteed for a specified period? 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- It is guaranteed for five years, but there is no guarantee that a wheat-grower will be permitted to produce wheat without regulation. No less than eight times during the course of his speech the Minister harked back to the subject of regulation of production. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- How could the industry be stabilized if a provision of that kind were not inserted in the bill? 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- I recommend the Minister to study the illuminating report read- by the honorable memher for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  during the course of his excellent speech on this subject last night. The world is desperately short of wheat. Production can be rapidly increased in only two ways. The first . is by giving a price incentive to growers. Therefore the 1945-46 crop should not be included in this scheme. The second is by guaranteeing a permanent right to produce without limitation, except of the farmers' own volition. It was shown in the British White Paper, issued in April this year, that in a normal pre-war year the regular import world trade was approximately 12,000,000 tons of wheat per annum, and that total world import requirements were now 32,000,000 tons. The London  *Economist*  of the 6th April, 1946, said - 

  >Owing to destruction of war, cyclones, tidal waves,- and disastrous droughts, crops in Asia and Africa have been severely reduced. 

The White Paper says that by great * efforts supplies against the. demand for 32,000,000 tons may reach 24,000,000 tons before the end of the crop year. Canada and the United States of America will export nearly 21,000,000 tons between them, compared with the pre-war average of less than 6,000,000- tons, but it is estimated that there will still be a deficit of 8,000,000 tons, and of the total supply obtained, 11,000,000 tons is a draft on stocks that cannot be repeated. The White Paper doubts whether conditions will -be any better next year. The position requires that every farmer in the world, particularly in countries like Australia that have not suffered the ravages of war, shall produce to the utmost. But farmers cannot produce unless they are given their rights. It- is immoral for the Government to include the 1945-46 crop in the scheme. The farmers had just suffered one of the most disastrous droughts in Australia's history, 

##### Mr Scully:

-- In the honorable member's district the farmers had the best season on record. ' 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- Yes, but to show the mighty wisdom of the honorable gentleman, I point out that my area is only a pocket of Australia. It extends 80 miles from Newcastle to the Liverpool Ranges and is from 30 to 40 miles wide. Did the southern areas of New South Wales have the best season on record? Did the wheat-growers in Australia generally have the best season on record? No ! 


 *J\3b* this very time the greatest  wheatproducing  State of Australia is undergoing one of its worst droughts. In  *The Land*  of Friday, the 12th July, 1946,  **Mr. H.**  Bartlett, the cereal specialist of the Department of Agriculture of New South Wales, said that the ^outlook for the. wheat crop in his State has seldom been worse than at present. He said that rain at the end of June benefited about 500,000 acres between Wagga and Albury, and in part of Southern Riverina. Elsewhere, the fate of 4,500,000 acres of crop hung in the balance. We may have another tremendous disaster with the wheat crop. Yet the Minister chooses this time to say to the farmers, "We will not give you what is legally and morally due to you ". I intensely dislike the policy of despair and hopelessness that apparently exists in the minds of the Minister, the Government, and the Government's advisers with regard to future needs of wheat in the world. When one realizes that in the eight years from 1938 to 1946 the population of India increased by 40,000,000 at the rate of 5,000,000 a year and that it is still rapidly increasing, one can see what vast potentialities exist. One of the great problems that the British have faced in India is that regardless of irrigation measures to stimulate food production the population has kept ahead of the supply of food, so great is the reproductive rate of the Indian peoples. We have heard about the possibility of Russia becoming a great exporter of wheat, but I consider  that that is very doubtful. The London 


 *Economist* recently, in some excellent articles on Russia, showed that before the war the western provinces were the preeminent grain producers and 40 per cent, of the. acreage sown was on collective farms. The material structure of farming in those areas has collapsed. Although Russia was able to move its secondary industries across the Urals there seems to have been lack of capacity to move the farming industries out of the lands invaded by the Germans. Statistics which are wholly Russian show that 137,000 tractors and 49,000 harvesters were destroyed by the Germans. Only 6,000 tractors .were evacuated in 1941-42 from the western provinces of Russia. The Soviet Government will probably not become an exporter of wheat, except for political reasons. For political reasons it exported wheat to France before the plebiscite on the alteration of the French Constitution and again before the French general elections. It will starve its own people to. export wheat if it deems that the political circumstances justify it.  Russia's  internaleconomic conditions are such that if it is to raise the living standards- of its people and not concentrate on war. it must consume more and more wheat within its own boundaries. 

There has been a lot of talk about the price of wheat. It has been pointed out that the Government takes no risk whatever, on previous experience and the probabilities of the future, in the price that is offering. After World War I., between 1919-20 and 1929-30, the average price for Australian wheat f.o.r. ports was 6s. lid. a bushel, Hid. more than the price now offered. The .average for tho five-year period was 6s. 6d. a bushel. I believe that if we are to encourage production people must be assured of the full benefit of all that they produce. I quote what  **Mr. John**  Teasdale has said, as reported in the  *West Australian*  of the 14th June last - 

  >One cannot dogmatize about the world's wheat position; it does seem that there cannot be any great fall in wheat prices for some years to come. After considering factors tending to raise or lower prices I consider that only extreme pessimists will 'consider that prices will drop 50 per cent, in the next five years below the present export price of 10s. per bushel f.o.b. ports. 

I think that  **Mr. Teasdale**  was very wise when he said that. 

The bill proposes to restrict production of wheat in Australia in two ways, by limiting ' the number of licences to be issued and by regulation of the acreage to be sown as has been said so of ten by the Minister. . 

##### Mr Scully:

-- Where is. there any proposal to limit licences or production? 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- If the Government does not issue more licences, it limits the number of licences and puts a stopper on production. The Minister ought to know better than I and most honorable members what that means, because some of the finest wheat land in Australia is in his electorate, but people cannot get licences to farm it, and therefore cannot produce. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- That is absolutely wrong. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- It is not wrong, as I shall show the Minister when I come to the undertakings that lie gave at Inverell, but has not honoured. Before the Minister interrupted me I said that restriction of production could take place in two ways, by not increasing the number of licences and by cutting production back by. regulation.  I' remind the Minister of the views expressed by him on the "Wheat Industry ("Way-time Control) Bill, which was brought down in 1940 by the then Minister for Commerce  **(.Sir Earle Page). His**  views then could not be improved upon as an expression of opinion on the bill that he has introduced. He said - 

  >One of the most objectionable features of the plan is the proposal to restrict the acreage to be sown next season. 

He went, on - 

  >Such a policy is inimical to thu best interests of Australia; and will not stabilize the industry. No other country has adopted a similar plan. 

Later he said - 

  >The restrictions being imposed on the "rowers under this plan are intolerable, and should not be accepted. No Soviet legislation more effectively deprives the subject of his liberty than do these regulations, which are an insult to the wheat-grower*. 

Then he put forward his own scheme with  regard to 3,000 bushels and said - 

  > The result of these regulations will be a calamity to the small growers. 

He went on- 

  >No regulation more soul-destroying or more destructive of industrial effort than the regulations now before us was ever issued even in Soviet Russia. 

Every word he said then applies equally  to this bill. It is utterly destructive of wheat-farming in Australia. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- You were the. first one tointroduce compulsory reduction of wheat acreage production. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- That remark is aninstance of the. Minister's usual inaccuracy. There is an old saying that if you are false in one thing you are false in everything. The Minister knows that it is utterly untrue to say that 1 introduced compulsory reduction of production. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- Who introduced it? 

Mi-. ABBOTT.- I did not. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- Your party did! 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- What my party did is not what I did. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- You were Assistant " "Minister for Commerce. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- Not when the bill was introduced. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- But later on. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- The Minister' was a horse-dealer once, and a dog-biscuit .man once. He has been everything. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order! . 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- Should we have" had the enormous development of the 'wheat industry of Australia if this policy of restriction had been imposed from the beginning? In 1860-61, Australian wheat acreage was 600,000 and the production 30,200,000 bushels, compared with ar acreage of 14,200,000 and a production of 210,000,000 bushels in 1939-40. Would the sturdy farmers of Australia have developed their heritage if they had had production restrictions imposed upon them ? It is grim humour on the part of the Government to encourage the sons of farmers to join " young farmers' " organizations when many of them can never become young farmers. The Government has erected " Trespassers Beware " notices in the wheat industry. Its policy is directed to make the wheatgrowing industry a monopoly. In New South Wales alone, approximately 7,000 certificates have been issued to exservicemen. Many of them, while they were serving in the forces, hoped that, on their discharge, they would be able to engage in wheat farming.. This bill will not assist them to do so. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture made only a brief reference to this subject. He said - 

  >Our normal pre-war basis of production can be maintained and it will be practicable to include in the industry soldier settlers and farmers' sons. 

It may be practicable or it may not, but the Minister has not indicated whether the State legislation contains any provision to ensure that ex-servicemen shall, without limitation, be granted licences to grow wheat. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- Does not the honorable member consider that the State governments have as much sense of responsibility to ex-servicemen as he has ? 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- Has no arrangement been made between the Commonwealth and the States to safeguard the interests of ex-servicemen who desire to. grow wheat? Doesthe Minister imply, by his' interjection, that the Commonwealth has not yet arranged with the States to assist ex-servicemen to become wheat-growers? Is the Minister's plan so half-baked that he has not considered those aspects? 

##### Mr Scully:

-- All those matters received consideration. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- I propose now to refer to the position of men who owned land when they joined the forces in 1939. When they were demobilized, they were notgranted a licence to grow wheat. To prove my statements, I quote from a report contained in the  *Northern Daily Leader*  of the 8th May last. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture met a deputation of the Land Settlement Subcommitee of the Inverell Branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which is inhis electorate. The first resolution to which his attention was directed was - 

  >That permanent wheat-farm registrations should be granted to all ex-servicemen wheatgrowers. 

The report states - 

  >One case that had come under notice was that of a man who had land at North Star. He had killed the timber, cleared the land, and was about to plant wheat, but enlisted and went overseas. He was now back, but the only permission he could get was to grow wheat for one year; a permanent registration would not be granted. He had arranged to sell the property to a returned ex-serviceman of this war, but the sale was subject to it being a permanently registered wheat farm. As he could not get this registration, the sale could not go on. The only reason why it was not a permanently registered farm, was that the . owner was fighting for his country. If he had stayed at home the farm would have been a registered wheat farm. There were more than 25 similar cases in New South Wales, and the deputation felt that something should be done, and done very promptly, to overcome such injustice. The intending purchaser 'of a property would have to purchase plant costing over £2,000, as it would be necessary to crop large areas in the North Star district, and no man could entertain the proposition when he could obtain a wheat licence for only oneyear. 
  >
  >The Minister, in replying, said that he was very glad that they had come along to bring these points under notice. When he took over he had to amend the wheat stabilization regulations under the National Security Act to the end of the year so far as the present registration was concerned.Whatever might happen afterwards would be a matter for the party that would be handling it after the elections. He appreciated that anomalies did exist in the present scheme, and he would further amend it so as to give authority to issue licences for at least the duration of the act. Queensland was definitely tied up by that act, but he lifted the restrictions, and told them to go ahead and grow all the wheat they could. Owing to transport difficulties, there was not enough wheat in Queensland to meet requirements, and the more wheat they grew the better it was for the Commonwealth. 
  >
  >In such cases as that mentioned, he wanted them to understand definitely that a wheat licence would be granted immediately. It was the height of stupidity, and absolutely wrong, to refuse licences in such cases. 

Yet by interjection a few minutes ago the Minister implied that the Commonwealth had not entered into any agreement with the States for the purpose of ensuring that ex-servicemen shall be granted licences to grow wheat. He misled the deputation, because he did not speak the truth. The cases to' which the deputation referred are not covered in Commonwealth or State legislation. The report continued- 

  >Another point that he particularly wanted to emphasize was that returned soldiers would definitely be given permanent wheat licences. 
  >
  >The responsibility for issuing the licences lias been  transferred  from the Commonwealth to the  States,  but the Minister has not made any binding arrangement for protecting the interests of ex-servicemen who desire to grow wheat. So far as he is concerned, those ex-servicemen simply do not exist. He declared that "there may be room " in the development of the wheat industry in the future to enable provision to be made for them; but such provision is not made in the Commonwealth or State legislation. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- That is not true. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- Eight times in his speech the Minister emphasized the necessity to regulate production.- He adopted ;t curious attitude. Early in his secondreading speech, he stated - lt provides growers with a guaranteed minimum price for wheat for five years, and has the machinery to maintain minimum price guarantees as a permanent feature. The effect will he to remove the feature which disturbed the industry most in the past; that is. the i in pact of unduly low prices. 

Then he declared - 

The States control production, and production must be regulated to the markets  avail-  ii bie for our wheat.  

Production must be regulated according to the markets available for our wheat ! If the markets of the world are heavily supplied with wheat during the five-year period, the farmers, although f.hey are guaranteed a price, are not guaranteed the right to grow so much wheat as they produced in the base period. The whole plan is an attempt to fool wheat-growers. The Government ha3 misled them. Later in his speech, the Minister stated - 

Production will be regulated in accordance with the markets available. 

Subsequently, he said - 

It is not proposed,, nor intended, that returns shall be permanently out of line with the export price, nor that the industry will lie continually subsidized. Two-thirds of our wheat goes onto the export market, and we must compete with' other countries for our markets. 

What a poorly-conceived stabilization  *scheme !*  It does not guarantee that the farmer will get the full advantage of high prices, but he will suffer all the disadvantages of low prices, because the quantity of wheat that he will be licensed to produce will be curtailed. The Minister asserted that the wheat-grower is guaranteed a price of 5s. 2d. a bushel. I remind him that if the quantity that he is permitted to grow is reduced by 10 per cent, or 20 per cent., the effect is . to reduce the price to 4s. 8d. a bushel. In 1940, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture stated in criticism of the Wheat Industry (War-time Control) Bill- 

The plan outlined by the Government completely' disregards the interest of small growers. 

Large growers,' can produce wheat profitably when the price is a little over 2s. per bushel; : the small farmer reaping not more than 400 acres of wheat finds his production costs much higher. The scheme submitted by the Government will strike the death knell of the small growers. The result of these regulations will be a calamity to the small growers. 

Every word that the Minister uttered on that occasion applies to this bill. No protection is provided for the small growers. If growers are instructed to reduce their crops by 10 per cent.,' the small growers will " get it in the neck " just as severely as will the large producers. But whereas the large producer' will be able to bear the blow, the small grower will not. As the honorable member for Calare  **(Mr. Breen)**  pointed out, many of the larger growers engage in mixed, farming and have sources of income other than the sale of their wheat. The small wheat-grower depends wholly upon the returns from his harvest. As the report of the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry showed, the costs of the small grower are always substantially higher than are the costs of the large grower. In the four principal wheat-producing States in 1935-36, the classification of wheat holdings was - 36,570 produced 3,070 bushels or . less, and 14,955 holdings produced over 3,070 bushels. The 36,570 holdings, which represented 70 per cent, of the total number, produced 47 per cent, of the Australian wheat crop, whilst the remaining 14,955 holdings, which represented 30 per cent, of the total, produced 53 per cent, of the crop. Those are the larger holdings. When we examine the position in. New South Wales,- the figures are even more impressive. According to the New South Wales  *Official Year-Book*  for 1938-39, that State, for the ten  seasons from 1933-34 . to 1943-44, had an average production of 51,634,000 bushels of wheat, or 32 per cent, of the total Australian harvest. Consequently, New South Wales is an important State in wheat. production. Of the 14,272 hold- ings in that State, 10,484, or 60 per cent, of .the total number, produced 22 per cent, of the wheat, and each of them grew less than 3,000 bushels. The remaining 40 per cent, of the holdings were responsible for 78 per cent, of the wheat grown. The Commonwealth  *Year-Book*  for 1940 showed that in 1935-36, 24 per cent, of the wheat-farms had no sheep. They were probably the holdings of the  ? mall wheat-growers, who are' wholly dependent upon the returns from the sale of their grain. The principle of applying  ;i.  general curtailment of the production of wheat to all farmers is entirely wrong. The previous scheme did not function on that basis. The small wheat-grower should not be compelled to suffer  as  severe  a  reduction  as  the large wheatgrower. As I have shown, the big majority of farmers produce less than 3,070 bushels. In 1940, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture said that the application of the guaranteed price to the first 3,000 bushels, and the spread of prices over the next 2,000 bushels, wouk embrace about 90 per cent, of the wheatgrowers of Australia. Why should the large growers who produce 78 per cent, of the New South Wales harvest, not bear the burden of any reduction of production before any restriction is imposed on small growers? It would have been more acceptable if the Minister had adhered to his previous plan, with some alterations, and been content to withdraw the licensing system, allow the unrestricted production of wheat, and grant  a  guaranteed price for the first 3,000 bushels of each producer's harvest.. The adoption of that plan would have obviated the necessity to restrict production. The larger growers would  Iia  ve curtailed production, -and all the growers would have known ,that They had a haven of shelter from the economic blizzards of the world. If it were necessary to impose a levy in order to preserve that position, a contributory 


 *Ifr.* Abbott. charge could, have been  imposed on every  bushel of wheat produced in Australia, except that intended for human consumption, and all the fanners would have derived the benefit. 

Last night, the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  pointed out in an admirable speech that under this scheme the wheat-growers stood to lose at least £57,000,000 during the next five years, and that the amount could easily total £70,0005000.  **Mr. J.**  S. Teasdale, of Western Australia, has also directed attention to this possibility. With the proposal to regulate production, it is doubtful whether "the Government will over be called upon to assist to finance the scheme. The Government may so regulate and curtail production that it can retain the growers' money and gradually distribute it until the wheat position has corrected itself.  

##### Mr POLLARD:<br><small class="text-muted">BALLAARAT, VICTORIA</small>

-- Restriction was a feature of the plan of the Government of which the honorable gentleman was a member. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- I arn not saying restriction was or was not a feature of the plan of the previous government. I do not believe in restriction that will affect the small wheat-growers. I believe that the small farmer should be given the benefit of the guaranteed price on the first 3,000 bushels of wheat he produces. 

I oppose the bill also because the limits of production are set compulsorily and not by individual action. If the 3,000-bushel quota had 'been maintained the limitation would have affected the big farmer, but now the burden will be placed upon the small farmer. The honorable member foi' Forrest  **(Mr. Lemmon)**  is interjecting, but he cannot be placed in the category of small farmers. 

##### Mr Lemmon:

-- I am a small farmer in Western Australia. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:

-- But Western Australia is not the only State to be considered. The farmers of New South Wales produce 32 per cent, of the wheat grown in the Commonwealth and the great majority of. them are-small farmers. The Government's scheme offers the farmers what will probably he a low price for the next five years, having regard to the state of the wheat market, our experience in i he years following the last war, the serious shortages, in wheat supplies at present, and the demands that are likely to be made by an increasing world population; This scheme will sovietize the industry, as the Minister said of an earlier bill. It will also prevent the development of new wheatgrowing areas, and* it makes no provision for the introduction ' of new. farmers. It will tend also to massacre the small farmers, and will result in the betrayal of ex-servicemen who are qualified to settle on the land. The Minister made certain statements to ex-servicemen at Inverell, but these have been dis-  honoured in the bill now before us, and in the arrangements that are to be made with the States. 

##### Mr McLEOD:<br><small class="text-muted">Wannon</small>

.- For the first time in the history of the wheat industry in Australia we have, in this bill, a stabilization plan which will cover a reasonable period. Under the Government's proposals the farmers will be assured, for five years at least, of a reasonable guaranteed price for their product. That, has never before been the case. I have listened with interest to the criticisms of the bill by honorable members opposite, particularly those of some eminent lawyers and other professional men; but I have not .been able to decide, from their remarks, where they stand in regard to the stabilization of the industry. It seems to me that they have no policy whatever in that connexion. The Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Menzies)**  said - 

  >We must seek to give a reasonable measure of stability to the whole of what might be described as the average wheat harvest, whether it" be sold in Australia or abroad. Therefore we must be prepared to protect the wheat-grower in respect of npt only that portion of his crop which is sold here but also a reasonable volume of production for export. 

That is a delightfully vague statement which does not commit the right honorable gentleman to anything at all, but I pay this tribute to him: unlike his Australian Country party associates he is at least honest. I agree with those who have said that the wheat industry is being regarded as a kind of political football. It is obvious to me that some honorable gentlemen opposite, realizing that we are on the eve of a general election, wish to protect themselves if the tragedy of the return of an anti-Labour government should. happen. It is for that reason that the Leader of the Opposition did not commit himself. He said in effect, " Let us .pay a reasonable price for a reasonable amount ". The right honorable gentleman at one time appeared to consider 2s. 6d. a 'bushel a generous payment, so I am unable to guess what he might regard as a reasonable payment. The honorable member for Indi  **(Mr. McEwen)**  has made a very different proposal, 'but I can see that if the antiLabour parties were returned to power, the Leader of the Opposition, if hebecame Prime Minister, would repudiate the proposals of the honorable member for Indi. I intend to test the sincerity of some honorable gentlemen opposite and, in particular, to expose the duplicity of the honorable member for Indi. The honorable member for Wimmera  **(Mr. Turnbull)**  asked us to forget the past. Of course, some honorable gentlemen opposite desire to forget their past, because it is so black. They have a deplorable record in relation to assistance for the farmers. But when this Government assumed office it- immediately set to work to help al] primary producers. 

##### Mr Bowden:

-- Do not .be silly! 

##### Mr McLEOD:

-- The honorable member for Gippsland  **(Mr. Bowden)**  once posed as a radical, but now he uses his vote, invariably, to help the banks, the big financial institutions, and vested interests generally. Honorable gentlemen opposite are trying to gull the farmers into believing that they would provide a better stabilization scheme than that- outlined in the bill. No doubt the daily prayer of the honorable member for Indi and politicians like him is, " Please give the wheat-farmers a short memory, and let us publicly forget what we did to them in the past ". 

A good many of the remarks that have been made about the wheat farmers by honorable gentlemen opposite in the course of this debate savour of rank hypocrisy. What did the honorable member for Indi do to assist the farmers when he was a member of the previous government? He did nothing. It was only after the Labour Government, came into office that the farmers received substantial help, as, in fact, did all those who were engaged in primary production. The Country party and the party that now calls itself Liberal have an extremely unsavoury record in this connexion, as an examination qf the pages of  *Hansard*  would show. When the people saw the error of their ways and returned the Labour party to power in the National Parliament the lot of the primary producers improved immediately. Honorable members opposite said that they would do things, but never did them. The Labour party said it would help the farmers and it has helped them. It will be a disaster for the wheatgrowers if, by any mischance, this Government does not retain office after the elections. I intend to remind honorable members of a certain statement of  **Mr. G.**  C. Marshman, a practical wheatgrower. He has stated in a section of thi! press '.hut he met the honorable member for Indi .in the corridor of this House while that honorable gentleman was a member of the Government. 

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- Is  **Mr. Marshman**  on the pay-roll? 

##### Mr McLEOD:

-- He is not on the payroll of the wheat merchants. He is a practical wheat-grower. It will  be known to those who are well informed on this subject that the Country party, when it was supporting the previous government, acquiesced in the appointment of seven merchants or their satellites to the Australian Wheat Board. 

##### Mr Bowden:

-- Out of how many members ? 

##### Mr McLEOD:

-- Out of nine. One of the others was appointed to represent the organized wheatgrowers and the second to represent the unorganized wheat-growers. Subsequently, when the change of government occurred, the outlook of primary producers, particularly the wheat-growers, improved immediately.  **Mr. Marshman**  was a member of the deputation of wheat-growers which visited Canberra for the purpose of seeking an increase of the price of wheat by 3d. a hi vh el. but the honorable member for 

Indi said that he would not embarrass the Government by asking for the increase at that time. I quote the following statement by  **Mr. Marshman**  from the  *Westralian Wheatgrower : -* 

  >Whilst on this visit wo met  **Mr.**  McEwen  in the corridors of Parliament House and made known to him the purpose of our deputation, and requested his support. The reply we  received was - " I refuse to embarrass the Government on such a matter at this time ". 

The honorable member for Indi said that he would not embarrass the Government because the, country was at war; but shortly afterwards, when the Labour Government was in office, Japan entered the war. Did the Labour Government* thereupon refuse to do anything more to help primary producers? We know very well that it did not. It provided a better price for wheat and it also introduced substantial subsidies, including a subsidy for superphosphate. The previous government budgeted for a war expenditure of ?100,000,000, but this Government has had to budget for as much as ?350,000,000 under that heading. Yet one of its earliest enactments provided a guaranteed price of 4s. for wheat at sidings. For the first time in their history, the Australian wheatgrowers received cash at sidings for their product.' The Government also had to make provision for the payment of subsidies on superphosphate, as well as on other necessaries such as bags and tractor parts. I continue the quotation from  *The Westralian Wheatgrower -* 

  >
 **Mr.** McEwen  did not send a reply . .' . ami angrily remarked that he resented such an approach to him and would ignore the circular and the body that sent it. Now he poses as the growers' champion. 


 **Mr. Marshman** went on to say ; 

T find it particularly difficult to reconcile the mon that were and the men that are, and would warn growers to be most cautious about taking action to. destroy a subsistence whilst they go out to chase a shadow. 1 stress what follows.  **Mr. Marshman**  has had a good deal of experience of politicians of the calibre of the honorable member for Indi. Referring to that honorable gentleman, he said - in reply to a question ait the Country party conference as to whether there was a limit to the quantity of wheat on which the Federal Country party would guarantee 5s. 2d. a bushel,  **Mr. McEwen**  replied : " No Treasury "ould sign a- blank cheque". 

That proves that the present opposition to the stabilization scheme proposed by the Government is purely political humbug. It is all very well to say, "Next year we will get a good price". As a primary producer, I have experienced the greatest hardship. After World War I., inflated land values, and the inflated prices of all commodities which the primary producer needs, ruined me. We want the wheat industry to have a stabilized price, not necessarily a high price. 

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- Then why are the wheat-growers opposing this scheme? 

##### Mr McLEOD:

-- The honorable member for Wimmera knows nothing about the wheat industry. For a long time he has been associated with dealers and agents. How he was returned as the representative of wheat-growers  puzzles  inn. 

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- I have been a wheatgrower and have never been a dealer. 

##### Mr McLEOD:

-- The honorable member has been associated with auctioneers and land " sharks ". Such interests naturally do not care for stability, but prefer booms and slumps. That is how they make large incomes. They are fearful lest the farmer may get out of their clutches. This scheme has been' brought down by the Government at the request of organizations of wheat-growers. If the honorable member for Wimmera were a wheat-grower whose future, and that of his sons, depended on what he produced, *would he take all that can be obtained from present-day prices or contribute a portion of it to a fund? Undoubtedly, he would say, "We will build up a fund". The wheat-farmer has sufficient brains to realize that, with the price of wheat at 10s. a bushel, there will be such productive activity in Europe that, by mechanized methods, a large surplus will be produced in the next two years, and the possibility is not remote that not a bushel of wheat will lie wanted from Australia. A glut can be caused as quickly as a surplus. The wheat-growers know that. When there is a glut Australia will be the first country to feel the effects of it. Therefore, the wheat-growers want security for the next five years. The Government is accepting a- risk in this matter. If the price of wheat falls below 5s. 2d. a bushel in the next five years, the Government will have to make good the deficiency. I wonder whether any merchant would take a similar risk. Would firms such as  Bungie's,  Darlings, and Dreyfus give similar conditions to the farmers? Would the honorable member for Indi guarantee to pay for the wheat grown by the honorable member for Forrest  **(Mr. Lemmon)**  on similar terms? This scheme will be reviewed during its currency. The value of it lies in the fact that for five years the wheat-growers will know where they stand. The Government is sympathetic to all ;primary producers, and has given them a far better deal than they received from anti-Labour governments. When honorable members opposite had the opportunity to assist the primary producers, particularly the wheat-growers, they did nothing.' They are making this a political issue. The honorable member for Indi has cited figures supplied by a man who, I understand, has made quite a lot of money out of speculations in wheat. Naturally, that gentleman does not want the industry to be stabilized; Certain interests are opposed to the stabilization of any industry. Had there been a stabilization scheme, based on similar principles, in the years from 1919-20 to 193S-39, what would have been the value of it to the wheat industry? The late  **Mr. J.**  E. Maycock, who, during his lifetime, was the secretary of the South Australian Wheat Growers Association, a member of the council of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, and a member of the Australian Wheat Board, and whose death represented a great loss to the wheat industry, prepared a table which was published in  *The South Australian Wheat-grower*  of the 22nd February last. It snowed that the total benefits of a stabilization plan to the farmers, had one been in operation for the twenty years from 1919 to 1939,

EXPLANATION OF TABLE. 

Column 1 shows the years in which the respective crops were grown. 

Column 2 shows the total amount of crop grown, including wheat retained on farms. 

Column 3 shows the amount of wheat estimated to be retained on farms to cover seed, feed, &amp;c. The amount is estimated at approximately 20,000,000 bushels, and any odd figures over millions are shown in this column in order to leave even millions" in Column 4. 

Column 4 is the amount of wheat actually sold in each year. 

Column 5 shows the average open market price f.o.r. in - each season. 

Column 0 shows the total amount received  by farmers in each season, with all wheat sold ;it the open market price shown in Column 5. 

Column 7 is the first column commencing to show what would have been received if the present Wheat Stabilization proposals had been in operation. This column assesses the amount used annually for local flour mid miscellaneous purposes at 37,000,000 bushels, being :i 1,500,000 bushels for local flour and 5,500,000 bushels for feed and miscellaneous purposes. This amount of wheat would always bo sold at 5s. 2d. per bushel. 

Column 8 shows the value of the balance of the crop sold for export at open market price when the price exceeded the stabilized floor price of 5s. 2d. 

When the open market price was less than the stabilized floor price of 5s. 2d., the price' is taken as 5s. 2d., because this is what the fanner would actually receive miller the Stabilization Plan. 

Column !) shows the total amount which would have been received by farmers in each year under stabilization and is the total of Columns 7 and 8. 

Column 10 shows the average price per bushel for each season when the value of the crop exceeded 5s. 2d. per bushel. 

Column 11 shows the stabilized price, being the amount received by the farmer, namely,  fis.  2d. per bushel and 40 per cent, of any excess over 5s. 2d. 

Column 12 shows the amount per bushel placed in the stabilization fund each year, being 00 per cent, of any excess over 5s. .2d. per bushel. 

Column 13 shows the total amount placed in the stabilization fund each year. 

VALUE  *01'*  THE WHEAT B.ETURN TABLE. 

The Wheat Table printed on the opposite  page i.a not printed to suggest that because farmers would have shown a profit of over  £1113.000,000  if the present stabilization plan had been in operation for the entire period between the two Great Wars, they are bound to make the same profit in the next 20 years. It is printed with the express purpose of showing farmers what would have happened, and they must examine it and form their own conclusions as to whether future benefits are likely to be greater or smaller. 

Some person will say that the stabilization floor price would have been less than 5s. 2d. for the period, hut in 1919-20 and in 1920-21 the f.o.r. price of wheat, which was based on London parity, was 8s. 10-id. and 8s. 6d. per bushel, bagged basis, respectively, and farmers were receiving this for every bushel they sold, as there was no Flour Tax legislation in existence. 

If is worthy of note that these prices were received under the old Compulsory Pool, and that in 1921-22, the first year of the open market, the price fell to 5s; 5}d. I do not suggest that the open market was the cause of this drop, but it is a point worth remembering. 

If wheat were sold to-day under the same conditions as in those years,- viz., London parity with Canadian, the price would be 7s. Did., bagged basis, f.o.b. Australia, and those farmers' friends, who do not farm themselves, would have had a better case for opposing stabilization at 5s. 2d. in 1919 to 1921 Mian they have to-day. 

It will be noticed that during the twenty years the highest price is 8s. 10id. There were nine years over 5s., three more over 4s., and sight lower than this. Let the farmer consider after studying the information set out in this paper, if better prices than these are likely to operate in the next twenty years. 

Critics will say the plan is not for twenty years. Unfortunately, it is not, but it is for five, maybe for six, and will be continued, and the decision the farmers have to make to-day is whether they will have it or not, and most "f them are going to reply with a very definite " Yes ". 

The figures in Columns 2 and 5, which are the basis of the table are supplied by the Government Statistician. 

In Column 2 it is estimated that approximately 20,000,000 bushels is retained on farms. This is arrived at by allowing 13,000,00(1 bushels for seed and 7,000,000 bushels retained for feed and other purposes. It is possible that many farmers will consider 20,000,000 too high a figure. If this is so, it would mean that there would be several million bushels more in each year to be sold, and this would increase the benefit of the Stabilization Plan to the farmer and its cost to the Government. 

In Column 7, 37,000,000 bushels per annum is allowed for flour and 'miscellaneous purposes, being an allowance of 31,500,000 bushels for local flour and 5,500,000 bushels for miscellaneous purposes. This is probably a fair assessment of the position in the period covered by the table, and the purpose of sotting up the table is to show what would have actually happened in that period. 

However, in applying the table to the future, any farmer may make his own estimate of the a mount likely to be sold for feed, which will depend on the encouragement and development or at least on the retention of our market for pig and poultry products. 

Twenty-five million bushels is estimated to be used for feed in the current year, but this is only an estimate; it is not a fact. 

In the coining 20 years we hope to see this amount exceeded, but many persons have a great fear that it is going to be very difficult to hold our market for pig and poultry products at its present level. 

If any farmer considers that more should he allowed for feed in the future, he must increase the amount sold at 5s. 2d. in those years in which the open market price exceeded5s. 2d., thus reducing the return to farmers in those years and reducing the benefit of the Stabilization Plan to farmers and its cost to the Government. 

The total result of the table showing the actual facts of the position for 20 years from war to war is as follows: - 


<graphic href="187331194607174_31_0.jpg"></graphic>


In selecting a period to test the stabilization proposals, it was desired to take a period which would be fair, and therefore instead of selecting any given number of years, which might have been claimed to either favour or to discount the plan, the whole period from the end of World War No. 1 to the commencement of the World War No. 2 was taken. 

It is a strange thing that whenever any proposal is put forward which would benefit farmers, it is always opposed by a number of persons who loudly protest that they desire to protect the farmers. 

One person inquired who supplied the funds. If we base our estimate of the future on our experience of the past, our table shows that the Government takes the risk of providing £ 108,000,000 and the farmers £21,927,583. 

How any farmers' friend can describe the plan as" an attempt by the Government to deprive the farmer of a portion of the market value of his production," or describe it as " picking the growers' pockets," passes my comprehension. 

These statements certainly presume that farmers are lacking in intelligence, and are. therefore an insult. 

It has also been said that the Government is not taking any risks. Farmers must form their own conclusions by studying the table relating to the past and forming their own estimates of the future. 

Honorable members opposite have never had the desire to stabilizeindustries. Many wheat-growers believe that when this bill has been passed by this House and the Senate, it will become law automatically. I stress that this is only the first step. Although the bill may be passed by the National Parliament, it will not become the law of the land unless complementary legislation is passed by the States. Although the Premiers of the States agreed to this scheme, it will still have to run the gauntlet of the last bastions of vested interests, the great stronghold of reaction, the legislative councils of the various States, the majority of whose members represent those who live on the toil of others and exploit themasses. All the planning of the wheat-growers, and all the efforts of their elected representatives in this National Parliament, will count for naught unless the scheme is approved by the Legislative Council of Victoria. Where do honorable members opposite stand? In those chambers they have confederates through whose instrumentality they can destroy this plan. I challenge them to declare themselves. They must know what they intend to do. I want to make it clear and definite that if the scheme is rejected by a State legislative council, open market conditions will prevail. Why do not honorable members opposite say without equivocation, " We are going to defeat this scheme in the State upper houses "? The wheatgrowers should be alert to this danger. We work under a dual system of government, and the final decision in the matter will rest with those who live on the toil of others. They, of course, will be against it. 

##### Mr Bowden:

-- The honorable gentleman is inviting them to turn it down. 

##### Mr McLEOD:

-- They are the confederates of honorable members opposite, who ought to tell them to put the measure through. I am very sorry that the honorable member for Wimmera, an electorate that has great traditions associated with the wheat-growing industry, should be opposing a plan which is designed to benefit the industry. When he travels about his electorate he will realize that the hard-working wheatgrowers are wholly in favour of stabilization, which they know to be their only hope. They do not want to go back to the old system of the open market, under which according to  **Mr. Dunstan,**  2,000 farmers  went off the land. Governments which were supported -by honorable members opposite gave the farmers a debt adjustment scheme, but they never brought in a wheat stabilization plan because that would have been against the interests of the merchants and the great combines. The purpose of this Government is to ensure that all sections of the primary producers shall obtain a fair return for their work. This has already been achieved for the dairy-farmers." Honorable members- opposite favour a return to open marketing. The farmers might prosper under such a system for this year, and. perhaps next, but eventually, when prices fell, they would be worse off than ever. ' We are told that prices would be regulated by the law of supply and demand, but the farmers have already been the victims of that law, and they are now demanding a more stable system. The Labour Government has proved that it can give stability to the industry, and honorable members opposite are jealous of its record. It is wrong for them to say that the Government is robbing the farmers. Under this arrangement, the farmers will get back every penny that they put into the fund, - the money, in the meantime, being invested in interest-bearing securities. I hope that prices will keep up, but, if they fall below a certain figure, the Government, under the plan, will be obliged to subsidize the wheat-growers. Honorable members opposite would destroy the stabilization plan for which the' farmers have  fought for years. Those who insist upon receiving 10s. a bushel now for their wheat, with no home-consumption price, will come to the Government, and demand a home consumption price when world parity prices fall. They should realize that they cannot have it both ways. As  I have said,, the fate of the scheme does not depend upon what is done in this Parliament, but upon what is done in State parliaments by the reactionary confederates of honorable members opposite. 

##### Mr Bowden:

-- Why not put them out of Parliament? . 

##### Mr McLEOD:

-- The franchise for the legislative councils is such that it is impossible to dislodge the reactionaries. Only those who own property of a certain value are permitted to vote. 

When it was proposed that all returned soldiers who had fought for their country should be given a vote the friends of honorable members opposite voted against the proposal. The honorable member for Gippsland  **(Mr. Bowden)**  ii a returned soldier, and he talks a great deal about what he will do for the servicemen. My opinion is that he will do for them just about as much as he has done for the wheat-farmers, and that is nothing at all. When they were down, he was ready to dump them. The Labour party is the only one that has. ever honoured the promises made to the farmers and provided stable marketing conditions. I am not surprised that the honorable member did not wish his past to be recalled, but in this instance it was necessary to do so. He and others like him have not altered their outlook. The 'honorable member for Indi is a typical example of a man whose- opinions have undergone no change. In 1940, he was asked by the wheat-growers of the Goulburn Valley to 'support their claim for a minimum price of 2s. 6d. a bushel," but he refused. For the benefit of the honorable member for Wimmera, who has so much to say, I quote the following: - 

  >On the 21st November, 1939, an amendment was moved to guarantee the wheat grower 3s. 6d. a bushel f.o.h. on the wheat acquired in the No. 2 pool. When Labour attempted to have a vote taken to allow Parliament to give a decision on this amendment, all the Country party members voted with the United Australia party members, and prevented Parliament from expressing its views in the matter. The  *Sydney Morning Herald,*  commenting on the Country party attitude in this regard, said " Gradually it began to dawn on the party that they were. 'on the spot'. They realized that, they must either support the motion or leave themselves open to the accusation that all their talking for the farmers was mere  sham-fighting '. "Members cast round for a way out. They found it by persuading the Government to shelve' the .debate, and breathed a sigh' of relief." 

That is the record of the men who now profess to be so generous, but we should compare their present protestations withtheir miserable attitude in the past. As for the amendment moved by the honorable member for Indi, I warn the growers, "Beware of the Greeks when they bring gifts ''. On a previous occasion, the honorable member for Darling 

Downs  **(Mr. Fadden)**  got into trouble with.the Leader of the Opposition regarding proposals for the stabilization of primary industry, and the Leader of the Opposition had to repudiate what the Leader of the Country party had said. In the. same way, two distinct policies for wheat stabilization are now being advanced by the Opposition, but neither will ever be applied. 

On the established facts, the growers should have no difficulty in deciding that they had been betrayed by the anti-Labour parties ; and on the same facts, they should have no difficulty in recognizing that the Labour Government has lifted their industry out of the unfortunate position in which it was placed by previous governments. Our purpose is to safeguard the future of the industry. It is easy to recognize the attempts of honorable members opposite and the interests they represent to undermine the Government's scheme, but I ask the growers to remember the record of those who now profess to be their friends. The growers received a raw deal from anti-Labour governments. There should have been a stabilization plan in operation at the end of the last war, and if there had been there would have been no insolvency amongst the fanners, and no need for debt adjustment. When a previous Labour Government endeavoured to have legislation passed providing for a guaranteed price for wheat, the proposal was defeated by the enemies of the Government in the Senate; . yet to-day, honorable members opposite persist in saying that, the Scullin- Government promised the farmers  4s.  for their wheat, but failed to honour its promise. I have no doubt that if the present stabilization proposal is defeated by the confederates in State parliaments of honorable members opposite, we shall be told once more that a Labour government failed to honour its -promises. I congratulate the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  upon the way he has co-operated with the organizations of the wheat-growers. He did not get angry with them, as did the honorable member for Indi when the growers asked for a modest increase of 3d. a bushel. The Minister's door has always been open to the growers, and now an effective stabilization plan has been introduced. I congratulate the Government upon having brought down, for thefirst time in the history of Australia, a stabilization scheme for the benefit of thewheat industry. 


 *Silting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.* 


##### Mr BOWDEN:<br><small class="text-muted">Gippsland</small>

.- This debate has been looked upon by honorable members as an opportunity tospeak of many things. I join in it not with the idea that I have anything new to propose, because I believe the statistics of the wheat story have been fairly well covered by many honorable members, but because the stabilization of primary industries is part and parcel of the policy of the Australian Country party and is therefore a matter of the highest importance. By stabilization we mean something which will ensure to the primary producer a reward from the nation commensurate with the service he renders to .it. For too many years the primary producer has been looked upon in the industrial field as the hewer of wood and the drawer of water. Because his industry is primary he has never been able to translate costs into prices - a privilege enjoyed by other producers - and consequently he has always been placed at a disadvantage. The deterioration of the economic position of the primary producers had its genesis in the unfair and excessively high tariff policy adopted by Australian governments in the past in an effort to protect secondary industries. Under that, policy manufacturers have been able to cover Australian costs by the fixation  of an Australian price. Let us consider the position of the worker by comparison with that of the primary producer. The basic-wage worker has his wage adjusted periodically to conform to commodity prices, whereas the farmer, on the other hand, having been obliged for many  veil  rs to take world parity prices, has had to carry a disproportionate share of the hurdon of the tariff. This stupidly unfair condition of affairs could only result in bankruptcy, with its corollary of debt adjustment boards, moratoriums and other devices to encourage him to continue pouring out his energy to feed a nation  which condemns him as a failure because he cannot meet one pound's worth of costs with ten shillings' worth of prices. That factor has been studiously avoided by honorable members opposite during the debate on this bill. To prevent the continuance of that very unfair condition of affairs, groups of farmers in several industries banded together in recent years and demanded recognition of their indisputable right to a place in the Australian economy, commensurate with their contribution to the national wealth. It is well known to everybody that that contribution represents approximately 90 per cent, in the exporting -field. Despite the claims of honorable members opposite that no attempts have ever been made by the parties sitting on this side of the House to stabilize the wheat industry, everybody recognizes that a great deal ofsuccess attended these efforts at organization in the past. Those engaged  in  the production of butter, dried fruits, preserved fruits, maize, peanuts, and many  other primary products have benefited greatly by the impact of producers' opinions on the various control boards. Now we come to consider the plight of the wheat-grower, who since the inception of a tariff policy which obliges him to pay £620 for a tractor which costs but £80 in the country of manufacture, has never had a chance. The wheat-grower is now -determined to demand some security in the future, for himself 'and his family. The protagonists of- high tariffs, traditionally the members of the Australian Labour party, have deliberately avoided any reference to the important fact that the farmer on a low wheat price overseas pays £80 worth of wheat for a tractor, but if a similar tractor is sent to Australia the Australian wheat-farmer has to pay an additional £520 to some authority in order to obtain possession of it. 

##### Mr Lazzarini:

-- Does the honorable member contend that the tariff policy is responsible for that? 

##### Mr BOWDEN:

-- That policy has undoubtedly brought about the ruin of the primary producers of this country. Some honorable members opposite in interesting addresses dealt ably and well with the proposal embodied in this bill; but there were two honorable gentlemen in particular who did not do so. One of them was the honorable member foi Wannon  **(Mr. McLeod),**  whose remarks before dinner invited a rebuke. However, I shall say no more now than that in the course of his speech the honorable gentleman made many offensive remarks and false accusations. The honorable member for Hume  **(Mr. Fuller),**  with many gesticulations last night treated his listeners to an interesting address. I might describe, it as a sermon in which he took as his text the Australian Country party. After many unfair and grossly untrue references to that distinguished body, of which he was obviously jealous, the honorable member suggested a rope and the nearest tree. We know that in recent history several other people have got rid of their most formidable opponents by that simple method, but it may not be so easy to get rid of the Australian Country party.  The electors whom he addressed will not find it more difficult than did honorable members of this House to. interpret the purport of his speech. It indicated a wholesome fear of the clan McDonald, and consequently lost much of ' its value. 

I support the amendment for the exclusion of the 1945-46 crop from the scheme, because the producers of wheat over a number of years have suffered from low prices and high costs, and they are entitled at least to the full -value of that crop in order to recoup some of their losses. Another point mentioned in the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country party  **(Mr. McEwen)**  relates to the cost of production, a subject which was very ably dealt with last night by the honorable, member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)-.**  The amendment provides for a guarantee to the wheat-grower of cost of production, plus  a margin of profit. '.No static price was fixed in the amendment to cover the cost of production. An amount of 3s. lOd. may have represented the cost of producing a- bushel of wheat in 1939, plus a margin of profit, but costs have now risen to 5s. 2d. a bushel, and who can say they will not rise to 7s. 2d. a bushel before the five-year period has expired?- The amendment makes provision' for fluctuations of that kind, and ensures that the wheatgrower will not lose. It will be remembered that after the first world war wheat prices maintained an average payable level for at least ten years. There was not nearly the devastation in that war that has been experienced in the war just ended, and I believe it is a reasonable proposition for the Government tq accede to the growers' request for a guaranteed price -for ten years. 

I propose now to refer to the very worthy gesture made by the honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard)**  when he suggested that as many people in Europe were starving they would not be in a position to pay a high price for wheat, and, accordingly, we should not hold- out for a high price over the next few years. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- I neither made nor supported, such a suggestion. That statement is entirely incorrect and constitutes grave misrepresentation. . 

##### Mr BOWDEN:

-- If the  *Hansard*  report of the honorable member's speech does not bear out what I have said I shall gladly withdraw the statement. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- On a point of order,  **Mr Speaker,**  I object to. the honorable member's statement. I made no such suggestion. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member has not made a point of order. 

##### Mr BOWDEN:

-- I am satisfied that what I have said correctly interprets the honorable member's remarks. Whilst I approve of the sentiment, I do- .not agree that it is the prerogative of the Australian wheat-grower to make such a gesture. The rehabilitation of the nations devastated by the war is a world responsibility. An obligation rests upon this Government to exploit every field for the establishment of markets all over the world in competition with other countries. If it does not -do that we shall be left without markets altogether. I echo the worthy sentiments of the honorable member, and I am prepared to do what I can towards helping the distressed peoples of the world over their difficulties. It has been interesting to listen to honorable members  opposite  preening themselves about the different conditions that exist in primary industries to-day as compared with those that prevailed under a form or administration, and drawing comparisons  between the  stabilization 'bill brought down in 1939 and the" bill now before us. We find, however, that that comparison upon analysis proves to be as odious as all other comparisons. In order to arrive at a fair comparison a reiteration of the problems which faced the two administrations is worth while. In the 1939 proposals 3s. lOd. a bushel, based on the growers' estimate of costs, plus a reasonable margin of profit, was above the world parity price, and it was well known when the arrangement was made that the scheme could not be financed from the sale of the wheat and had necessarily to be financed by contributions from the Treasury. At least such a proposal has been the merit of sincerity. Contrast that, with the conditions under which the Government proposes to establish its stabilization plan to-day. The guaranteed price to-day is much below the realizable value of the wheat. The Treasury will not need to finance it, at least as regards the 1945-46 crop, and I think there are bright prospects of that condition continuing throughout the currency of the scheme. So, instead of having to make contributions from the Treasury the Government adopts the simple process of taking a part of the realizable value of the wheat and placing  it in .a fund against the day when the realizable value of the wheat is below the guaranteed price. It will then go to the farmer and say, " We will supplement the price you have obtained with some of your own money, and, understand, old boy, that this munificent gesture could come only from a Labour government ". When one considers the safeguards against the possibility of the Treasury making contributions after the five-year period one comes to the conclusion that it will be not a stabilization- fund but compulsory saving, and the same end could be reached within the five years by the farmers themselves placing the  money in  the bank. The Government proposes to give them some of their own money and to take no risk at all, because for five years at least there will be no fear of its having to subvent the fund from the Treasury. So it is not a stabilization fund in that sense. 

I refer again to the. speech of the honorable member for Ballarat  **(Mr. Pollard-).**  I am not condemning it, because it was the most temperate that he has ever delivered in this House, but he referred unfortunately to 1929-31, and the Scullin Administration, and he tried to use that depressing period to jibe at some other party or institution. No fair-minded man will condemn that government for any of the measures it took to get out of the extremely difficult position it found itself in. I am fair enough to recognize that, but I am not so simple as to allow that to be turned against myself for the benefit of my political opponents. The then Prime Minister, finding the nation insolvent, started the " Grow more wheat " campaign in order to meet the nation's debts overseas, and, of course, the honorable member for Ballarat said that he promised the farmers 4s. a bushel but discovered that the Senate or the banks would not allow that amount to be paid, ft would be a reasonable thing for any administration to discover that obstacle before asking the farmers to incur the cost, but that was not done. The farmers loyally responded to the call to solve the nation's financial difficulties, and the net result to them of their patriotic effort was another £50,000,000 of debt, which has never been removed from them. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Repatriation &middot; FRANKLIN, TASMANIA &middot; ALP</small>

-- The Country party defeated the 4s. guarantee. 

##### Mr BOWDEN:

-- The honorable member is making political capital again. I do not blame that government for the measures it took to meet the. prevailing conditions, but it introduced high customs duties and thereby pressed the farmers deeper into the mire, for, on top of producing the wheat that saved the nation's name and solvency, they had to pay high prices for the commodities and equipment that they had to import in order to grow the wheat. It was the inception of that policy that compelled the wheat-farmers to take world parity for their wheat and to pay high Australian costs for the goods they needed. That was the genesis of the farmers' trouble, and no one can gainsay it. ' 

The. amendment, moved by the honorable member for Indi is not acceptable to the Government because it was moved by a member of the Australian Country party. There is nothing in the amendment that would, cause the farmers to lose anything. On the contrary they would gain. They would be in a better position by having one year in which to sell at  prevaling  prices, and thereafter the cost of production plus a fair margin of profit. I commend that to the wheatfarmers. I agree with the honorable member for Wimmera that 95 "per cent, of them are satisfied with the proposition contained in the amendment. Any one' would think, from the talk of honorable gentlemen opposite, that we are trying to kill the bill instead of trying to improve it. 

##### Mr FRosT:

-- The honorable member knows that it is a good bill, because the Australian Country party is trying to extend it to last for ten years instead of five. 

##### Mr BOWDEN:

-- It is not good. The Administration proposes to take a part of the farmers' money and then give it back*1 to them in a bad year. Acceptance of the amendment would cost the Government nothing. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- Does not the amendment provide for practically the same thing, a 50 per cent, levy? 

##### Mr BOWDEN:

-- Exactly, but the amendment gives a little more cash at sidings. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- Yes, but the honorable member has mentioned only one season. 

##### Mr BOWDEN:

-- And excluded that season. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- The honorable member is not game to take the risk. 

##### Mr BOWDEN:

-- We are taking the risk for ten years. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- There is the confidence ' trick. 

##### Mr BOWDEN:

-- The Government is taking no risk. We are taking the risk of costs of production rising, a risk that the Minister will not take. 

##### Mr RUSSELL:

-- Who is taking the risk, the Government or the Australian Country party? 

##### Mr BOWDEN:

-- I advise the honorable member todeal with Oliver Badman. He will give the honorable member enough to chew on for the rest of his life. I rose to support the amendment and to mention the facts that contributed to the perilous position of primary production. Without the huge war expenditure, which demanded no balance-sheets, and which enabled the Government fortunate enough to be on the treasury-bench to throw money around in such a manner that some of it had to stick to the primary producers, the Labour party would not have even professed concern for them. If I went back in history I could contradict a good deal of what the Government claims it has done for the primary producers. Its concern for them is of recent origin. It showed no concern till it discovered that, without bread, it could not hope to govern the country. I support every paragraph of the amendment. There is nothing in it that the Government could not accept. 

##### Mr RUSSELL:<br><small class="text-muted">Grey</small>

.- I have listened with deep interest to the speeches that have been delivered on this bill, and I must candidly say that the members of the Opposition have conveyed to me the impression that they are talking against this measure merely because it was introduced by the present Government. That is the only conclusion any one could arrive at, especially after having listened to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition  **(Mr. Menzies).** 

I represent the largest wheat-growing division in the Commonwealth. Twothirds of the wheat produced in South Australia and 80 per cent, of the barley grown in the Commonwealth is grown in the division of Grey. I have been directly and indirectly interested in the primary producer all of my life, and I have always lived in the division of Grey. For those reasons I am qualified to express an opinion on this bill. 

Naturally, I have met some farmers who are opposed to the measure, but I am happy to say that the huge majority of wheat-growers in my division are whole-heartedly behind it. Moreover, the growers generally are doubtful about some persons who are now galavanting around South Australia in a frantic endeavour to throw cold water on this proposition, and are curious as to who is paying the expenses of these paid agents. 

For consistent inconsistencies I know of nothing worse than the statements of some honorable gentlemen opposite about the wheat industry. It was only as the result of continual pressure by the Labour party that the Menzies Government brought down its scheme to pay wheatgrowers 3s. l0d. a bushel f.o.b., which, after the deduction of expenses for freight, storage, handling, and excess wheat, would return the growers only about 2s.10d. a bushel. The Leader of the Opposition and the right honorable member for Cowper  **(Sir Earle Page),**  and other honorable members opposite stated that that scheme would stabilize the wheat industry, but I maintain that it would not cover cost of production in all cases. It was condemned by the majority of wheatgrowers. Particular interest and significance attach to the publicly expressed views of both the right honorable member for Kooyong  **(Mr. Menzies),**  as Prime Minister, and  **Senator McLeay,**  its Leader of the Senate, in announcing the amount of the financial assistanceto be made available for the purpose of that scheme. They said - 

  >We are now able to announce that we have arranged, not only that the amount of the advances shall be increased to 2s.10d. a bushel for bagged wheat, less rail freight, and 2s.81/2d. a bushel for bulk wheat, less rail freight, thus giving an average return of 2s. 6d. a bushel onbagged wheat at the country siding, but also that the advance shall be paid in one amount as soonas practicable after delivery of the wheat. We earnestly say that these financial proposals represent, . not only a fair but a generous approach to the problem by the Government. 

Later, the then Prime Minister made a statement of particular interest to growers at that time in his comment on the finance to be provided for No. 1 and No. 2 pools. He said - 

  >We cannot continue to provide large sum of public money to support the wheat-growers while they go on producing unsellable grain - such a procedure would he demoralizing and unsound. 

Yet, in the light of these statements, we find him condemning the present proposals of the Government. 

I cannot allow the Opposition's arguments to go unchallenged in the light  of the following figures showing the movement of the incomes of primary producers between the financial years 1939-40 and 1943-44:-

### QUESTION

{:#subdebate-27-0}
#### INCOME TAX - PRIMARY PRODUCERS

The number of primary producers with actual incomes in excess of £250 per annum has increased between the financial years 1939-40 and 1943-44 from 53,400 to 117,500, or approximately 120 per cent. 

It appears that the  Opposition  is interested only in the returns of the big producers, and I desire to submit figures correctly compiled by probably the largest primary producer, if not the largest, in South Australia. The correctness of these figures I am prepared to accept. They cover a period from the 1922-23 to the 1942-43 harvests - that is, 21 years - and show that had the firm received 5s. 2d. a bushel - the guaranteed floor price, equal to 4s. 6id. a. bushel at its - railway . sidings - its return would have been £17,353 17s. 3d., less the amount the firm would have contributed to the fund, £2,615 5s. 5d. This proves that the firm would "have benefited by £14,738 lis. lOd. over the period of 21 years. I say unhesitatingly that to the operators of this firm and all others similarly placed this would have meant the difference between, on the one hand, fear of the loss of the farm and a general closure, and on the other hand, prosperity and contentment. With the consent of honorable members, I shall incorporate in  *Hansard*  the following schedule : - 


<graphic href="187331194607174_38_2.jpg"></graphic>


It has never generally been admitted that South Australian producers have been placed in the unenviable position of hav ing to accept, year in and year out, 3d. a bushel less for their wheat than growers in New South WaleS and Victoria receive. 

I point out, in reference to the schedule of the producer in South Australia, that  **Mr. Chapman**  has costed 16 of the 21 years, and the average cost per bushel has been 4s. 0¼d.  and the average price, including bounties, has been 4s.  0¾d.  The old bogy of the purchasing value of money has been raised against the plan. It is a remarkable fact that in. those sixteen years of costing, the average per acre for three years, well spaced, . was 12 bushels. Thus, the 1922-23 season averaged 12.06 bushels per acre, and the cost to produce was 4s. 9.22d. a bushel. The 1926-27 season averaged 12 bushels, and the cost of production was os. 2.64d. a bushel. The 1944-45 season averaged 12 bushels, and the cost was 4s. 7.8d. a bushel. This conveys to me that with modern methods and reduced interest charges, with price control and .even higher labour costs, the firm can produce a bushel of wheat in the 1.944-45 season at a cost slightly lower than twenty years ago. 

Some farmers resent the 1945-46 crop being incorporated in the plan. An; investigation of this aspect from a taxation point of view is interesting, particularly in the light of the figures that I have read to-night. These show that primary producers' incomes of -£1,000 a year have increased between the years 1939-40 and 1943-44 by" 350 per cent. Admittedly, all were not wheat-growers. However, assuming that a wheat-grower has an assessable . income of £1,000 from all sources of farm revenue, that he produces 5,000 bushels of wheat and receives ls. a bushel more by the exclusion of the 1945-46 crop, he will then have raised his assessable income to £1,250. That increase will raise his assessable tax by approximately £125 - a gift to the Treasury of 6d. a bushel. If the money is placed in the 50 per cent, retention fund, he is actually contributing only 6d. a bushel to ensure a guaranteed minimum price of os. 2d. f.o.r. bagged basis for five years, with the right of review in three years, and with no downward alteration of the 5s. 2d. in the review. 

Wheat merchants are said to be desperately anxious to re-enter the field of competition. On whose behalf are they so genuinely interested? Is it for themselves, after having had their "activities suppressed for some years, or is it with a desire to assist the primary producers? 1 am most definitely of the opinion that their interest is purely selfish. When one takes into consideration their huge office rents, staff salaries, telegram costs, rents for the stacking sites, and their equipment - and naturally they would have to buy much new equipment for the season - can the Opposition explain how the merchants would operate fairly to the producers and at the same time not compensate themselves for the huge extra overhead, working expenses, and purchase of material ? This amendment is  merely a political move by the Opposition to help the merchants so that they will have the right to operate for this season. Then, should the Government be defeated - that is . not likely to occur - the Opposition will again allow the merchants to take command of the wheat industry. Chaos would then prevail! Insolvencies would again mount up. During seven years in South Australia when the anti-Labour Government was in power, we had 2,060 farm insolvencies in that State alone. 

I- can imagine how happy the merchants such as Bunge .(Australia) Proprietary Limited and Louis Dreyfus and Company would be to take command of the grain industry in the Commonwealth to-day. However, I am perfectly satisfied that this Government will still be in office after the general elections. 

This measure will give to the exserviceman the opportunity to enter into the wheat-growing industry -with a definite basis of security. He will know his guaranteed minimum price. He will no longer be the political tool of politicians and governments. He will rest with a sense of security, and a knowledge that his only danger will be from drought. 

I am confident that farmers will not overlook the fact that the Chifley Government had made this plan available to the Australian Wheat Growers Federation for the future security of the wheat industry. No previous government ever made the same sane, practical attempt. 

The  support  of the wheat-growers will ensure the return of the present Government. 

Every effort will be made to reduce the costs of production in the wheat industry. The Parliament has a duty to the industry, and the nation itself, to pass this legislation to provide for guaranteed prices to the wheat-growers in. the future. The long-term wheat stabilization plan not only gives security to the farmer with regard to his financial future, hut also will help to stabilize land values, and thus obviate inflationary trends such as those which occurred after he last war, when some farmers unfortunately paid up to £30 an acre for land on which to grow wheat. Under this plan, that will never occur. At the same time, an economic depression will never again affect land values. The scheme will have a stabilizing influence on the economic security of the man on the land, and from that point of view, the bill should be passed. 

I commend the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture for the outstanding interest that he has shown in and the kindly consideration that he has extended to the producers since he has been in office. I express to him my personal- appreciation, and gratitude, because whenever I have approached him on behalf of the producers, he has given ro the proposal a sympathetic hearing ;ind consideration. I support the bill. 

##### Mr MCDONALD:<br><small class="text-muted">Corangamite</small>

-- I have listened with interest to the speeches that have been delivered on this bill, but  *T*  have been more interested in the very clever manner in which most supporters of the Government' have dodged the real issues. One of the most important and worst features of the bill is the fact that the plan includes the 1945-46 crop. Only one honorable member opposite, namely, the honorable member for Forrest  **(Mr. ..Lemmon),**  attempted  to justify this action, and he pointed out that this arrangement was made under agreement with the Wheat Growers Federation. I remind him of the gentleman who a week ago in Sydney forfeited £200 under a similar agreement. When a gun was pointed at his head, he decided that his life was worth more than £200, and handed over the money.. The Government has told the wheat-growers: " Unless you agree to the inclusion of the 1945-46 crop, there will not be any stabilization plan." Listening to the remarks of honorable members opposite one would be tempted to believe that this benevolent Government is prepared to spend public money to assist the wheatgrowers to reach a position of affluence in the years ahead, but in truth the Government will not spend one penny of its money on .this scheme. As a matter of fact, it will be withholding from the wheat-growers a percentage of the money which they, by their own energy and work, have earned and have taken great risks to earn. It is well to remember these things, because we have been told  that,  in past years, the wheat-growers have been the football of politicians. The honorable member for Hume  **(Mr. Fuller)**  said, about a dozen time.= last night, that that was so. Most of the speech of the honorable gentleman was devoted to reminders of what has happened to the wheat-growers in the last twenty years or so. It was noticeable that he carefully refrained from recounting the experiences of the wheat-grower.? in the last three or four years. I did not notice the honorable gentleman say that the Scully plan had been a wonderful thing for the wheat-growers, or that it had given the small growers a guaranteed price but had left the large scale wheat-farmers who, after all, are the backbone of this industry, to get whatever they could, which, in some instances, was as little as 2s. a bushel for their first payment. I do not wonder that honorable members opposite have refrained from referring to such an iniquitous scheme. Honorable members should not lose sight of the fact that this stabilization scheme is designed to ensure a payment of 5s. 2d. a bushel at a time when the overseas price of wheat is very much in excess of that price, and that it is being proposed by a Government which put into operation a year or two ago a plan which forced many largescale wheat-growers out of the industry. Honorable members opposite did not -mention, . either, that . this Government paid almost £2,000,000 to prospective wheat-growers in Western Australia not to sow their crops, and this at a time when it was expending almost another £2,000,000 in building distilleries to produce petrol from wheat. It is only fair that the wheat-growers of Australia should be reminded of these facts in relation to the administration of a government which has boasted that it is the true friend of primary producers and of wheat-growers in particular. 

I remind the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture also that the wheat industry has been bolstered up at the cost of growers of oats- and hay. A greater amount of wheat was produced and sent overseas because oats and hay could not be exported. An offer was received of 7s. 6d. a bushel for a very large parcel of oats for export, but tho Government would not permit it to be sent outside Australia. 

##### Mr POLLARD:

-- A total of 396,000 bushels of oats was exported' last year, which is 100,000 bushels more than was exported in any other of the last ten years. 

##### Mr McDONALD:<br><small class="text-muted">CORANGAMITE, VICTORIA &middot; UAP; LP from 1944</small>

-- That may be so, but there was never a time in the history of the world when our oats was so badly needed on the other side of the world or when sales could have been made to such good advantage. I remind honorable members, too, that growers of oats and hay were urged by this Government to increase their production last year, and the Government even commandeered oats from racehorse owners; yet those who sowed a bigger area to oats last year than formerly were; in fact, thrown to the wolves after having incurred the expense of harvesting their crops. It is true that the Government fixed a ceiling price at £6' 10s. a ton for hay; but it did not fix a floor price. The result has been that growers of hay have been compelled to accept as low as £2 15s. a ton for hay, which is an absolutely unpayable price. That was done because these growers were unorganized, whereas the wheat-growers were organized. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member had better return to the stabilization plan. 

##### Mr McDONALD:

-- I respectfully submit,  **Mr. Speaker,**  that as the Government has permitted greater quantities of wheat to be exported because it would not allow oats to leave the country, my remarks have a direct bearing on the bill and this aspect of the subject should be discussed. 

##### Mr FROST:<br><small class="text-muted">ALP</small>

-- Did the honorable gentleman object to the shipping of the wheat? 

##### Mr McDONALD:

-- I did not; but I am also in favour of allowing oats to be exported. . I do not think that Australia can take pride in- the quantity of foodstuffs which it has shipped overseas, particularly to the Mother Country, where the rationing of foodstuffs is more severe now than it was during the war years. Although the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture may bc satisfied with what has been done, I am very far from satisfied. We should have done infinitely better than we have done. We have the spectacle in the western districts of Victoria of many stacks of  unthreshed  oats standing in the paddocks, although one one of the most famous races on earth is reared on oats. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! Oatmeal is hardly relevant to the hill. 

##### Mr McDONALD:

-- With respect,  **Mr. Speaker,**  I do not think that you could have been listening to my argument. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order! The honorable gentleman should not mistake tolerance for deafness. 

##### Mr McDONALD:

-- In my opinion, it is not possible properly to discuss a plan for the stabilization of a particular primary product without dealing with other primary products closely related to it. If the Government had as much regard for the primary producers as it would have us believe it has, it would have done more for the growers of oats and hay than it has done, particularly as it encouraged them to increase production in order to accumulate reserves of fodder. 

##### Mr Fuller:

-- Does the honorable member believe in shipping everything out of Australia? 

##### Mr McDONALD:

-- I do not believe in anything that the honorable member believes in. I believe in the Government standing up to its responsibilities and obligations. I consider that this Government has run away from its undoubted obligations to certain sections- of .primary producers. If we should have another drought in Australia, and conditions in some areas are not very promising to-day, we may find that our reserves of fodder will become still further depleted, particularly as the growers of hay and oats have been treated so unfairly. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- Order ! The honorable member must return to the bill or resume his seat. 

##### Mr McDONALD:

-- I shall return to the bill,  **Mr. Speaker.**  I point out that as the result of the Government's policy, land which has been prepared for sowing to oats may now be sown to wheat. 

The Minister has said that this scheme will be an encouragement to exservicemen. I cannot see that that will be so. I do not believe that the exserviceman will be satisfied with it in any way, because the system, of licensing is apparently to be preserved. I know that ex-servicemen in my own electorate are still being required to fill in forms for licences to grow wheat. One of them told mo the other day that he had been required to give all kinds of information about himself, except the colour of his eyes, and this at a time when we need wheat as never before and when everything possible should be clone to encourage the production of wheat! Some of the most successful ex-servicemen in my electorate had sown their crops before their licences were granted. They got a flying start. But if they had not been men of initiative the position would have been very different. The season would have been too late for them to sow their crops after their licences arrived. 

I favour an effective stabilization plan, but I shall not be a party to permitting honorable gentlemen opposite to pretend to the people of this country that this Government is prepared to spend millions of pounds of public money to stabilize the wheat industry. As a matter of fact, if the industry should be stabilized under this scheme, it will be done by taking a part of the earnings of the farmers over a period of five years and holding it to meet eventualities. The Government is saying, in effect, " If wheat prices fall we are prepared to bring the guaranteed price up to 5s. 2d. a bushel ". The Government-, is- giving nothing for nothing. It will be using the wheat-growers' money to do whatever may need to be done. When the previous Government was in office and wheat was valued at only about 2s. 6d. a bushel on the world market, it was prepared to pay a stabilized price to the wheat-growers and to advance as much as 6d. or even ls. a bushel to achieve this end. If the proposed committee to inquire into the cost of wheat production in Australia be not appointed, the people of Australia will continue to have the advantage of purchasing wheat at below the cost of production. That is a state of affairs which would be quite unfair to the wheat-growers. To-day the wheatgrowers are paying exorbitant prices for the machinery they require to produce their crops. I agree with the honorable member for Forrest  **(Mr. Lemmon)**  that nowadays one man can do as much as two men could do formerly with the old horse teams, but we are fast reaching the stage where a farmer cannot afford to purchase an up-to-date plant until he is almost in a position to retire. A man in that position will not be induced to work day and night to produce a huge crop of wheat. He could live in tolerable comfort without doing anything of the kind. If the Government accepts the amendments foreshadowed by the honorable member -for Indi, something worthwhile could probably be done with this bill, but if the Government persists in its iniquitous plan to include in the scheme the 1945-46 season, in respect of which sowing was done more than twelve months ago and harvesting more than six months ago,  in order to  ensure a stabilization scheme over the next four years, it -will be so manifestly unfair that even this Government will not be able to survive the shock of it. 

##### Mr RANKIN:<br><small class="text-muted">Bendigo</small>

.- I intend to support the amendment of the honorable member for Indi-  **(Mr. McEwen).**  I intend also to criticize the bill and to express views which I know are held by growers in my electorate which, incidentally, is one of the. most important wheat-growing districts in Australia. I am concerned because 50,000 wheat-growers of Australia have had a very raw deal, not only from governments, but also from nature, during the last seven or eight years. They have battled along courageously throughout the war years, and have submitted to the very worst that nature and governments could do to them. Now when nature has come over to their side somewhat, and they have some prospect of recouping .themselves for the losses they have suffered, this Government brings forward this so-called stabilization plan. At the very best this is no more than an equalization plan, and it is being put forward at the expense not of the Government or of the general community, which has been able to buy cheap food during the last four or five years, but at the expense of the wheatgrowers themselves. I have heard ministerial supporters say that there is no doubt that the wheat-growers are more prosperous . to-day than they have ever been before, and that they are now receiving high prices for their product because a Labour government is in power. They know very well that there is no connexion between the two things ; that for ten years after "World War I. the price of wheat for export averaged 63. Id. a bushel; that to-day the export price is 10s. 6d. a bushel; that there has never been such a world shortage of wheat in the history of man as there is at the present time; that never previously in the history of the world had so many of the young, strong men who were capable of producing been diverted from the production of food as have been diverted during the last five or six years, in which we have been engaged in a calamitous war ; and that never previously have so many young men been slain as were destroyed in that war. Every one knows that for the next five years there will be no possibility of a surplus of food throughout the world, or of the Government being required to contribute one penny to the stabilization or equalization scheme that we are now considering. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- No one can be certain of that. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- Possibly no one can be certain of it, but it is obvious to anybody who studies the facts. The risk 13 so slight that even the Government of which the honorable member is a supporter is prepared to take it. We have been told that under this Labour Govern ment all primary industries are tremendously strong, and that never previously in their history have they been so successful. Honorable members opposite ignore the fact that 502,000 men were engaged in .primary industries in 1939, and that the occupation survey made in July qf last year disclosed that there were then only' 416,000, or 86,000 fewer. 

##### Mr BARNARD:<br><small class="text-muted">BASS, TASMANIA</small>

-- To what causes does the honorable member attribute that decline? 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- .There are many causes, but the greatest is that the Government decided to place secondary industries' under the cost-plus system and to produce . food cheaply for industrialists at the expense of primary industries. 

##### Mr Barnard:

-- The honorable  membeknows  perfectly well that it was due to the war. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- The war definitely had a tremendous effect. But, although many men who had been engaged in primary industries took part in the conflict, the number was not sufficient to cause the change that has occurred.Honorable members opposite claim that under this Labour Government primary producers have been successful and prosperous. What are" the facts? The total area under all" crops in 1938-39 was 23,500,000 acres. In 1942-43 the area was 17,400,000 ; in 1943-44, 15,900,000 acres; and in 1944-45, 17,400,000, a drop of more than 6,000,000 acres during the regime of the present Government. The area under wheat in 1938-39 was 14,300,000 acres; in 1942-43, 9,200,000 acres; in 1943-44, 7,800,000 acres, and in 1944-45 only 8,400,000* acres, despite the increase of price and the promises of the Government. The area under barley was reduced by more than 100,000 acres ; and under maize, by approximately 80,000 acres. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- It was a government supported by the honorable member which first placed restrictions on acreage. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- Whatever restrictions were then imposed, they were increased by the present Government, whose army of inspectors has driven men out of primary industries and forced them into secondary industries. The Government believed that they would be misled into voting for it. Unquestionably the wheat industry has had the worst deal that has been given to any industry in Australia. Practically all secondary industries were placed on a cost-plus basis. The dairying industry received some assistance from the Government, even though it was robbed of more than £2,000,000 which the Government received by way of subsidy from the United Kingdom Government. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The honorable gentleman must deal with the wheat industry. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- With due respect to you, sir, I wish to compare the wheat industry with other Australian industries, with a view to justifying a demand that justice shall be done to the wheatgrowers. 

##### Mr SPEAKER:

-- The purpose of this bill is to stabilize the wheat industry. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- That is perfectly correct. But I claim that I am entitled to state the position of other primary and secondary industries, and to urge the Government to mete out to the wheat industry treatment similar to that accorded to those other industries. In fairness, you must concede that I am justified, particularly as the Government has withdrawn 52,000,000 bushels of wheat from No. 7 pool for use as stock feed, not at its own expense or the expense ofthe community . as a whole, but solely at the expense of the wheat-growers. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- That is not true. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- I am giving to the House information that was supplied by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to the manager of the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, when arrangements were being made for an advance to the wheat-growers. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- That is not true, either. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- It is true. I can produce the document, signed by the Assistant Secretary to the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- What is the date of it? 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- I am not worrying about the date. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- The honorable member is dodging the issue. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- I am not. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- The date is very relevant. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- If the honorable member is anxious to have the date, I shall endeavour to give it. The Minister cannot deny that the figures were supplied over the signature of the Assistant Secretary to the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. The Government withdrew 52,000,000 bushels of wheat from No. 7 pool, and gave it to producers of butter, eggs, meat, &amp;c. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- A proportion of it was given to many wheat-growers. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- I admit that. It is one of the few statesmanlike actions of the Minister, and I thoroughly agree with it. But I object to one section of the community being expected to carry the whole of the burden. Butter, eggs, meat and wool should be produced cheaply in time of war, not only for our own needs, but also to help Great Britain and our allies. . I thoroughly agree with the provision of cheap stock feed, but I definitely contend that the wheat industry should not have been expected to carry the whole of the burden. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- Payment for wheat from No. 7 pool is at the rate of 6s. 51/2d. a bushel. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- The wheat-growers were not given a fair deal. The honorable member for Ballarat knows something about potatoes, but nothing about wheat. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- I know that a government supported by the honorable member was responsible for potato-growers being paid 25s. a ton. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- The honorable member for Ballarat attended a meeting at which action was taken which upset the pig market. Exporters of pig meats, aided and abetted by the honorable member, who I believe was Assistant Minister for Commerce and Agriculture at one time, were responsible for some of the worst examples of black-marketing that could be conceived. 

##### Mr Pollard:

-- That is not true. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- They were also aided and abetted by persons who at one time were employed by certain very large exporting firms. I have no doubt that those persons will receive a pat on the  back for the very good work that they did for these big firms, when the Government decides to relinquish control and they return to their former employment. 

##### Mr Pollard:

--  That is a lying statement. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- It is not a lying statement ; it is the truth, and the honorable member knows it. 

##### Mr Pollard:

--  It is a lie. 

##### Mr RANKIN:

-- That interjection is characteristic of the honorable member. You,  **Mr. Speaker,**  and the House know that the wheat-growers have not had a fair deal. Various industries have been bolstered up during the war at the expense of the wheat industry, and the wheat-growers made no fuss over that. However, now that the war is over, they expect theGovernment to give them a fair deal. If they are given an opportunity they will very soon rehabilitate themselves, and will not ask for help from this or any other government. In particular, they demand that the 1945- 46 crop shall not be included in the stabilization scheme. It was a small crop, of which about 50 per cent, will be exported, and the Government proposes to take from the growers a large proportion of the return which they should receive on exported wheat, and to use it for the benefit of its stabilization plan, although individual growers may never participate in the benefit of the plan. A farmer may sell his property, perhaps for health reasons, or he may hand it over to his son on his return from the war. If, for any reason, he leaves the industry he will not be recouped for any of the money he put into the pool. If the plan is applied to the 1945-46 crop the direct financial loss to growers will be as follows :  -

The big growers in the Riverina, in the north-west and north-east of Victoria, and in SouthAustralia and Western Australia, who produce up to  *10,000*  bushels of wheat, will be deprived of more than £500 under the Government's plan, and that at a time when they are in urgent need of the money. With it they could repair fences and buildings and buy new machinery. During the war it was practically impossible to obtain wire. Posts, which used to cost £4 10s. a hundred, are now £12 10s., and machinery has been practically unprocurable. A harvester which would have cost £80 before 1939 now costs £200. In spite of the Government subsidy the cost of fertilizer has increased by 25 per cent., whilst its quality has deteriorated. Instead of taking from the farmers their just returns, the Government should encourage them to produce more, because never at any time was the need for production greater in the interest of Australia and of the Empire, and of the starving peoples of the world. The wheat-growers have struggled through years of drought and semidrought, and have carried on while their sons were away serving in the armed forces. They have put up with shortage of labour, shortage of fertilizers and shortage of machinery; yet the Government is now proposing to take from them the reward of their industry. The wheatgrowing industry is the second largest in Australia, and the economic welfare of the nation is bound up with it. It will be greatly to the discredit of the Government if it refuses to give to the growers a fair. deal. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:<br><small class="text-muted">Richmond</small>

.- As the last  speaker  in the debate from this side of the House, I reiterate the question to which the farmers will demand an answer, if not in this House, then on the hustings during the forthcoming elections - why does the Government propose to include the 1945-46 wheat crop in its stabilization scheme for 1946-47 onwards? Why is it proposed to keep from the growers £10,000,000 which ought to be in their pockets now? The honorable member for Hume  **(Mr. Fuller)**  evaded the question. He spoke on every aspect of the matter except that. He refused to explain why the Government was stealing the proceeds of the 1945-46 crop from the growers. In a few weeks, Government supporters will go out and tell the people the story which they have told so often here. They will recount the evils of twenty years ago. They will say what the Bruce-Page Government did not do, what the Lyons Government might have done, and what the Scullin Government attempted to do. They will tell the people everything except what the unfortunate growers really want to know, namely, why the Government is taking from them a large proportion of the proceeds of their 1945-46 crop. The growers do not want to know what happened during the "last war. They do not want to know what happened ten years ago, or even what happened during this war. The question they are asking themselves, and which they will also ask Government representatives, is "What about my bank account to-day?" There is about £10,000,000 involved in this steal - no other word can describe it. 

##### Mr Scully:

--  -The honorable member should keep to bananas1 - he knows more about them. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:

-- I know something about .this matter, also. We have been told that the' stabilization scheme was introduced to help the wheat-growers, who are to benefit from the generosity of the Government. The falseness of that claim has been fully exposed in the course of this debate. It has been shown that' the growers will not get one sou from the Government. Clearly the reason for bringing this proposal before Parliament in its dying hours is that,. . if it were delayed, it would be even more difficult for the Government to justify the inclusion of the 1945-46 crop in the scheme, and the £1.0,000,000 of which I have spoken might be lost to it forever. 

Another question which demands an answer is why the Government proposes to go on giving the farmers' wheat to other sections of the community at a price less than the wheat would realize on the open market. I refer to those who feed wheat to stock - dairy-farmers, poultryfarmers, &amp;c. - and I admit that many of those benefiting from the arrangement are my own constituents. Up till now they have been able to buy wheat for about 4s. a bushel. When the stabilizascheme is in operation, they will buy their wheat at the home-consumption price. They are glad to get cheap wheat, but they should not be getting it at the expense of the growers. If wheat is to be supplied to stock-raisers at less than the market price, the difference ought to be made up out of Consolidated Revenue. In other words, the whole community should pay, not the wheatgrower only. If the growers were  able  to sell their wheat on the open market they would receive 10s. a bushel for 28,000,000 bushels, instead of 5s. 2d. 

##### Mr FULLER:<br><small class="text-muted">HUME, NEW SOUTH WALES &middot; ALP</small>

--  There are some dairyfarmers and poultry-farmers in my electorate, too. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:

-- Neither the dairyfarmers nor the poultry-farmers would consider that they were receiving justice if one-third of their production was taken away from them and sold at less than the fair market price ; yet that is what happened to the wheat-grower. I do not contend that there is no justification for allowing the poultry-raiser and the stock-feed processors to purchase wheat at a low price, but if that is to be done it should be at the expense of the whole of the people and not merely of a few. The honorable member for Grey  **(Mr. Russell)**  with great gusto pointed out that there had been an improvement of the incomes of primary producers during the period in which this Government has been in office. That is probably quite' true, because periods of war have always brought increases of the prices of foodstuffs and commodities of various kinds. There is grave misconception on the part of the Minister when he contends that this Government has dealt  generously with the dairying industry, just as it is dealing generously with the wheat industry in the bill now before us. Although the subsidies paid to the dairying industry have run into many millions of pounds, if dairy farmers were, permitted to operate on a free market, the price of butter to-day instead of being ls. 7d. per lb. would be nearer 3s. per lb. 

##### Mr Breen:

--  In the United States of America butter is sold on the free market for' 6s. 6d. per lb. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:

-- That is so. Instead of conferring a benefit, the granting of the subsidy to dairy farmers has deprived them of a free market price and has cost them many millions of pounds which could not be covered by the subsidy. What possible justification can there be for including the 1945-46 harvest in the stabilization scheme and thereby taking from the pockets of the wheat-growers an amount' estimated to be approximately £10,000,000 which would otherwise go into their banking accounts? As a practical farmer the Minister is well aware of the plight of the wheat-growers and of the fact that because of seasonal fluctuations their incomes can only be based on the average of perhaps three successive seasons. Never was there a time when the Australian wheat-grower needed more urgently the return he hopes to get from this season's harvest. 

##### Mr LEMMon:

--  Nonsense ! 

##### Mr ANTHONY:

-- Last season the wheat yield amounted to 123,000,000 bushels, but in the preceding season it amounted to only 45,000,000 bushels. The 1943-44 season was one of the worst in the history of wheat-growing in Australia. Yet the honorable member characterizes as nonsense our claim that the wheat-growers need the full proceeds of the 1945-46 harvest to carry on. In the 1943-44 season the crops harvested in Victoria were not even sufficient to feed horses on the farm properties. 

##### Mr Lemmon:

--  Yet it is impossible to buy a wheat-farm to-day. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:

-It is also impossible to buy a property of any description, even a house or a business. Although the bill has many desirable features it is unacceptable because of its imperfections and obvious omissions. I have no doubt that the Minister, as a practical farmer, has the welfare of the wheat-growers at heart, and that he has been badly advised or has been forced to agree to this plan against his will. No justification has been advanced to warrant the inclusion of the 1945-46 harvest in the plan. No doubt it will he pointed out that the whole of the money paid into the stabilization fund from the 1945-46 harvest will ultimately be returned to the wheat-growers. That may be true, and there would be no argument against the proposal if those now engaged in the wheat industry remained in it until 1950. The Minister must be well aware,however, that those engaged in primary industries drift, not only toother forms of primary production, but also to the cities, and accordingly many of the growers who contribute to the pool during the 1945-46 season will not share in the distribution of the proceeds of the stabilization fund in 1950. It would be difficult indeed to assess the percentage of those now engaged in the industry who will still be engaged in it after a lapse of five years. If the Minister will not accept the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country party  **(Mr. McEwen)**  I trust that he will at least reconsider the implications of the bill, as it is at present drafted, with a view to meting out more equitable treatment to those whom it is ostensibly designed to assist. 

##### Mr SCULLY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Commerce and Agriculture &middot; Gwydir &middot; ALP</small>

--  *in reply*  - I have listened with great interest to the speeches delivered on this important bill by members from both sides of the House. I wish to compliment some of the younger members, ' especially the newer members representing country constituencies on the Government side of the House, for their notable contributions to the debate and the manner in which they have effectively refuted the arguments of those who opposed the bill. I have been somewhat puzzled by the varying opinions expressed by the opponents of this plan. As the debate progressed it became increasingly evident that many honorable members opposite know very little about wheat production or the stabilization plan outlined in the measure. Generally speaking, however, the tone of the debate has been on a high level. Amongst the opponents of the measure the honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron)**  made the most notable contribution to the debate. He displayed practical knowledge of the subject. Although his ideas onwhat constitutes a real stabilization scheme for the wheat industry are diametrically opposed to my own, his approach to the subject was marked by fairness and logic. I also express my appreciation of the manner in which the Leader of the. Opposition  **(Mr. Menzies)**  discussed the bill.  His  attitude was in marked contrast to that of. the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country party  **(Mr. McEwen),**  whose extravagant statements seemed to echothe stated  views of his party prior to the last general elections. It will be recalled that at that time the Labour Government had offered the wheat-growers under the quota "plan a price of 4s. a bushel at country sidings, whereupon the Leader of the Australian Country party  **(Mr. Fadden),**  in a memorable speech at Toowoomba, extravagantly promised the growers a price of 4s. Sd. a bushel for all wheat produced. This extravagant promise, however, was quickly repudiated by the Leader of the Liberal party  **(Mr. Menzies),**  and the clash between the two parties then in Opposition gave rise to an intense press controversy. The Leader of the Australian Country party made other extravagant promises  which were repudiated by the Leader of the Liberal party. As a matter of fact," we do not know to-day whether the Australian Country party has any concrete ideas on stabilization or whether, if it has, it would put them into- effect. At the last general elections, however, the wheat-growers showed that they were satisfied with the treatment received from the Government and returned it to office. They were -obviously tired of the promises made and reiterated by the Australian Country party which were not honoured when that party shared the reins of office with the United Australia party at a time when the industry was in the direst need of practical assistance. The Leader of the Opposition is a most astute barrister, one of the highest legal authorities in Australia and one of. the ablest debaters in this House, but he was at a loss to advance any satisfactory reason for opposition to the bill. He did, however, seize upon it as an opportunity to get in some advance opposition to the Government's referendum proposals. He took from- my secondreading speech the statement that there was a promise of co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth oh this wheat stabilization plan, and said that he did not doubt that at all, but that the same principle could be carried into effect through all sections of primary pro~duction and that, therefore, there was no need for an affirmative vote from the people on the marketing proposals that will be put before them when the referendum is taken on election day. I remind him and other honorable gentleman that at the Constitution Convention the Premiers  of the States unanimously agreed to transfer to the Commonwealth certain powers, and that, although the democratically elected lower houses passed legislation- to give effect to their pledge, some of the conservative upper houses either rejected it or so drastically altered it as to destroy its worth. The same fate may await this plan in the legislative councils of the States. It is incumbent on every man who has the welfare of the wheat industry at heart to do everything humanly possible to ensure that the upper houses shall not bc a stumbling block to effect being given to the desire of the wheat industry for effective stabilization. I do not claim that everything in this plan is perfect, but it is an attempt to solve a most serious problem, and it has the backing of the overwhelming majority- of" the wheat-growers of Australia and their organizations. 

##### Mr Archie Cameron:

-- Put that to the test of the vote. . 

##### Mr SCULLY:

-- That means a poll of wheat-growers. 

##### Mr Archie Cameron:

-- Hear, hear! 

##### Mr SCULLY:

-- I am absolutely opposed to that. It is a clever dodge to sidetrack and destroy the wheat stabilization plan. The Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron),**  who favour - a poll of the wheat-growers, believe in the open market. They believe in the old order that enabled the international wheat speculators to batten and fatten on the wheat-growers for years. It is peculiar that, whereas the Leader of the Opposition demands a poll of the wheat-growers on this plan, the honorable member "for Indi  **(Mr. McEwen),**  who opened the debate on behalf of the Australian Country party, did not mention a poll. Nor did any subsequent  speaker  on behalf of the Australian Country party. That in itself should show the wheat-growers that if they were left to tho tender mercies of the Opposition, they would have ho plan at all for the stabilization of their industry. Such a variety of opinions about the wheat.growing industry exists opposite, and so diametrically opposed arc. the policies of the two sections of the Opposition on the matter of wheat that any plan that their joint efforts brought before the Parliament would fail because it would not have the confidence of the growers. I repeat that this plan has the endorsement of the great majority of the individual wheat-growers and their organizations. 

##### Mr Anthony:

--  How can the Minister say that without the evidence of n noli? ' ifr. SCULLY. - I have more evidence than any other person in Australia could have of the support of the wheat-growers for this plan. I met representatives of their organizations in Sydney in December. 

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

--  Not from Wimmera. 

##### Mr SCULLY:

-- The delegation that met me contained the representatives of organizations that have members throughout the Wimmera. On behalf of the Government, I submitted certain proposals to the conference. I take leave to point out at this stage that the conference was organized, not by me, but by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. When I submitted the Government's proposals, they asked, "May we take these proposals away and discuss them  *in camera Y" I*  said, "Yes, go and discuss them for as long as you like, and, when you have come to a decision, whatever it is, notify me and I will meet you again ". Among those present were the honorable member for Forrest  **(Mr. Lemmon)**  rand officials of the Australian Wheat . Growers Federation. Other wheat-growers who are not representative members of the federation, were also present. Later they came back to the conference room and the  chairman  of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation,  **Mr. H.**  T. Chapman, of South Australia, submitted to me certain proposals. I said, "All right, these proposals are not identical with the proposals that I submitted to you. Are these proposals unanimously endorsed by your wheat-growers' conference? "  **Mr. Chapman**  said, "Yes" All the others were there including  **Mr. Nock**  and  **Mr. Roberton**  and all acquiesced. Not one man expressed an adverse opinion. I asked that at that juncture no publicity be given to the proposals, because I had to submit them to the Cabinet. I took the plan proposed by. the Australian Wheat Growers Federation to the Cabinet for consideration. My job was not easy, but subsequently the whole plan was agreed to. That is the plan set out in this bill. Of course, the honorable member for Indi sneered, as did the honorable member for Wimmera to a lesser degree, that the only persons who agreed to the plan are on the pay-roll of the Government. Since E have been a member of Parliament in both' the State and the Commonwealth, I I do. not think I have heard a more despicable reference than that to worthy men. After all, who are these men who are supposed to be on the pay-roll of the Government? One is  **Mr. Cullen,**  the executive member of the Wheat Stabilization Board, and, T think, a prominent member of the Country party in Victoria. He was appointed to his position by my predecessor, a member of the Country party. When I became Minister I had enough decency not to interfere with appointments to official positions made by him. I do not believe in victimization. The men concerned have done great work over the years. I have never asked them to express opinions contrary to their own. I have never asked a member of the Australian Wheat Board to express opinions contrary to his own. Members of the Australian Wheat Board are the elect of the wheat-growers of Australia, not the elect of the big business men who speculate in wheat. They were appointed by the self-styled friends of the Australian wheat-growers of Australia, the members of a party that is a country party in name only and is really the champion of vested interests. When E took office there were only two representatives of the wheat-growers on the Australian Wheat Board, whereas to-day, with the exception of  **Mr. Gatehouse,**  who is the millers' representative on the board, and who was appointed by the previous Government, all the members df th6 board are practical farmers from the different States. They have given valuable service on behalf of the wheatgrowers and the general community. Yet the honorable member for Indi implied  that I had control over them and that I had perpetrated a gold-brick deceit.  **"Mr. McEwen.-**  That is quite true. 

##### Mr SCULLY:

-- That is a miserable reflection on men who have served Australia well. The regulations that govern the operations of the Australian Wheat Board are the regulations that, were introduced by the previous Government. 

##### Mr McEwen:

-- The Minister has had  **Mr. Cullen**  touring the country for years at the expense of the Government expounding his policy. 

##### Mr SCULLY:

-- If the honorable member says that I ever directed  **Mr. Cullen**  to go anywhere or to make any statement, it is a miserable lie. 

##### Mr McEWEN:<br><small class="text-muted">INDI, VICTORIA &middot; CP; LCL from 1940; CP from 1943</small>

-- I cannot prove it, and 1. do not charge the Minister, but I do say that it is a fact. 

##### Mr ACTING DEPUTY SPEAKER:<br><small class="text-muted">Mr. Barnard</small>

-- Order ! 

##### Mr SCULLY:

-- It is a contemptible thing for an honorable member to use the privileges of the Parliament to make innuendos and insinuations against the integrity of  honest  men like  **Mr. Cullen**  and the other men who are doing a great job on behalf of Australia. But I will not be led astray by the interjections of the honorable member for Indi. I do not consider that most of the other points made by honorable gentlemen opposite warrant a reply. 

One of the principal criticisms directed against the bill was the inclusion of the 1945-46 pool in the stabilization plan. Honorable members know perfectly well that in order to obtain an effective stabilization, we must begin the scheme when prices are high. No one can forecast accurately how Jong the present high prices will continue. The honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron),**  who, in my opinion, is a greater authority on the wheat industry than is any other member of the Opposition, warned us that wheat prices on the world market might fall rapidly. In a very effective speech, he emphasized that European countries, which had. been devastated during the war, would rapidly redevelop their agriculture. Supporting his statements ' are the views of the  chairman  of the Canadian Wheat Pool,  **Mr.**  McIver,  who warned the wheatgrowers of that Dominion not to plant extravagantly large acreages this year. 

He advised- them to sow the coarser grains. The Canadian Wheat Pool could not guarantee how long the present inflated prices of wheat would continue. The principal official of Unrra,  **Mr. Jackson,**  who recently returned to Australia, considered that Europe 'and North Africa would rapidly resume the production of grain. Statements that high prices will continue indefinitely are mere guesswork, and every wheat-growers' organization throughout Australia is anxious that the wheat  stabilization plan shall be introduced immediately. 

References have been made in this debate to "the decisions of the conference of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation in Perth recently. Members of the Australian Country party, who are making a political football of the wheat stabilization plan, heralded those decisions as marking the doom of the Government's scheme. The  president  and: secretary of the federation invited me to meet them in conference in Sydney, and I agreed to do so. With the exception of two men, only one of whom was a Western Australian, those present at that conference supported the present stabilization proposals. Furthermore, when I promised them that I would .recommend to Cabinet the appointment of a commission to inquire into costs in the wheat industry and that a representative of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation would be appointed to it, they seemed perfectly satisfied, and supported the plan  *m toto.*  One of the gentlemen who attended the conference was  **Mr. Ernie**  Field, who cannot be described as a supporter of the Labour party. He is probably the oldest member of the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales, and is also a member of the Australian Wheat Board. Appointed to the board by the previous Government, he was re-elected to the position by the wheat-growers of New South Wales. He publicly supported the wheat stabilization plan, in its' entirety, and described it as the greatest plan that has ever been or is likely to be submitted to the wheatgrowers of Australia. He advised farmers to " grasp the plan with both hands, because it means security for an indefinite period". Never before have wheat-growers enjoyed that degree of security. 

A few months ago, I received an invitation to attend the annual conference of the Wheat-growers Union of New South Wales. For many years, I have been in the public life of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, and I say without fear of contradiction that that assembly was the most representative gathering of primary producers that I had ever attended. I was privileged for a while to listen to the discussions. I exercised no particular influence on the decisions, because the day before I attended the conference, members had unanimously agreed to. a resolution approving the wheat stabilization plan.In my presence, the delegates discussed this all-important subject, namely, the inclusion inthe stabilization scheme of the 1945-46 crop.The outstanding feature of the debate was that the organizations representing the largest growers of wheat last year, namely, those in the northern, north-western and central western parts of New South Wales, who would be the largest contributors to the stabilization fund, were unanimously in favour of the inclusion in the scheme of the 1945-46 pool.. That provides an effective answer to the objections raised by the honorable member for Richmond. 

Some honorable members opposite have condemned the quota plan, or "Scully plan as it has been termed. The honorable member for Maranoa  **(Mr. Adermann)**  became "hot under the collar" when be referred to it as the "iniquitous Scully plan". This afternoon, however, the honorable member for New England  **(Mr. Abbott)**  almost embraced me in his enthusiasm for the 3,000 bushel quota, and emphasized its advantages to the economy of the small wheatgrowers. Although both honorable members  are  members  of the Australian Countryparty. they expressed conflicting views regarding theplan. I place on record my hope, that if through circumstances  the  production  of  wheat has to  berestricted,  the 3,000 bushel quotaplan willbe restored. The  big wheat-growercancarry  oneffectively with areduced acreage,butacurtailment of  acreage  means disasterto the small grower, who depends wholly on his wheat harvest for his income. When the 

Government guaranteed the payment of 4s. a bushel at country sidings on the first 3,000 bushels of every wheat-grower's crop, the farmer had an assured income of £600 a year.From wheat-growers in many parts of Australia, I have received praise for the quota plan. Even since the formulation of the stabilization plan, I have had definite requests from various centres that I should not depart from the quota plan, because it was. the salvation of the small wheat-grower. If honorable members doubt these statements, they should ask the Rural Bank of New South Wales and country bank managers about the financial position of the small wheat-growers to-day. At one wheat-growers' conference which I attended, a man with a property near Wagga Wagga or Albury stated publicly that as the result of the quota plan, he was able for the first time to look his creditors in the face. And he was the third generation of a wheat-growing family. With the exception of farmers whose crops have been affected . by droughts, the wheat-growers are in a better financial position to-day than they have ever been before. That is due to the Government's foresight and courage in introducing the quota plan. 

In conclusion, I inform the Opposition that the Government intends to proceed with the bill. It will not accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Indi, or conduct a ballot to obtain the views of wheat-growers regarding the plan. The objective of members of the Opposition is to destroy the efficacy of the bill - a bill which all wheat-growers throughout Australia will applaud. I advise them to return to their respective States and influence members of the Legislative Councils to pass the complementary State legislation, thereby giving to the wheat-growers the security which for so long has been denied to them.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. 

Original question resolved in the affirmative. 

Bill read a second time, and committed  *pro forma;*  progress reported. 

Message recommending appropriation reported. 


 *In committee* (Consideration of Governor-General's message) : 

Motion (by  **Mr. Scully)**  proposed - 

That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act relating to the stabilization of the wheat industry. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">Barker &middot; ALP</small>

.- Will the Minister tell me which clause of the bill makes it necessary to appropriate revenue? I appreciate that an appropriation of revenue will be necessary in connexion with the Wheat Export Charge Bill, but I cannot see any provision in this measure which needs to be covered by an appropriation under section 56 of the Constitution. 

##### Mr Scully:

--  Such an appropriation is necessary for the purposes of clause 31 (5). 

Question resolved in the affirmative. 

Resolution reported and -  *by leave -*  adopted. 


 *In committee:* Consideration resumed. 

Clause 1 agreed to. 

Clause 2 - 

  >This act shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. 

##### Mr SCULLY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Commerce and Agriculture &middot; Gwydir &middot; ALP</small>

.- I move - 

  >That the clause be left out and the following clause inserted in lieu thereof: - "2. The several sections of this act shall commence on such dates as are respectively fixed by proclamation." 

The clause provides that the act shall come into operation on the date fixed by proclamation. It will be convenient, however, to proclaim some sections before others. For example, provision will have to be made for the election of a new board, but it will be convenient for the present board to carry on the administration under war-time regulations until the new board can be appointed. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">Barker &middot; ALP</small>

.- The fact that the Minister finds it necessary to move this amendment is an indication that, although this plan must have been under consideration for many months before the introduction of this bill, the measure has been submitted to us in an unsatisfactory form. Every one who had given any thought to the subject would have realized that provision would be necessary to meet the circumstances that the Minister has indicated. I wish to know now whether our acceptance of this amendment will preclude any member of the Opposition from moving an amendment later in regard to the date upon which the measure will come into operation? 

The  **CHAIRMAN (Mr. Riordan).The**  honorable member may later move an. amendment to the words which the Minister is proposing to insert. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:

-- I foreshadow an amendment to provide that the act shall not be proclaimed earlier than the 1st October, 1946. 

THE  CHAIRMAN.  - I shall submit the Minister's amendment in two parts. I shall first put the question " That the clause be agreed to ". If the committee negatives the clause I shall put the question, that the proposed new clause be inserted. At that stage, the honorable member for Barker may submit his amendment. 

Clause negatived. 

Amendment (by  **Mr. Scully)**  proposed - 

  >That the following new clause 2, be inserted: - " 2. .That the ' several sections of this actshall commence on 'such dates as are respectively fixed- by proclamation." 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">Barker &middot; ALP</small>

--  I intend to submit two amendments to the Minister's proposed new clause. I first move - 

  >That, the following words be added to the proposed new clause: - "but not earlier than the first day of October, One thousand nine hundred and forty-six." 

I hope that the purpose of the amendment is clear to the Government. Its submission is dictated by the determination of the Opposition' that this bill shall not become an act and have  any force or effect until justice has been done to the wheat-growers in connexion with the 1945-46 crop. It will be of no use for the ' Minister for Commerce' and Agriculture  **(Mr. Scully)**  to assure the committee, as I have no doubt he will, that a meeting of members of the Australian Wheat Growers Federaton or of some other body has agreed to the proposed stabilization scheme. This is not a matter which can be settled by any organization on behalf of the wheatgrowers. Each grower is individually the owner of his own wheat. The wheat crop of the 1945-46 season was sown under war conditions and war-time legislation. It was grown, reaped and delivered under war-time legislation. That legislation provided that every . grower must deliver his wheat to the pool, and that it should be acquired by the Commonwealth in the terms of the Constitution, by the process prescribed'" National Security Regulations. Under those constitutional provisions, it is neither just nor meet that the grower should be asked to make' any con tribution to the Commonwealth. The crop was grown and delivered for war purposes. This legislation should  deal with the wheat industry on a peace-time basis. There is no justification whatever for including in" a peacetime stabilization scheme a crop that was  grown .under war conditions, restriction.;, and regulations for war purposes. Therefore, the Opposition will be on perfectly fair ground in pressing the amendment. 

##### Mr SCULLY:<br><small class="text-muted">Minister for Commerce and Agriculture &middot; Gwydir &middot; ALP</small>

.- I am not prepared to accept the amendment. Its acceptance would upset the whole stabilization scheme. Furthermore, the Government wishes to proceed with the election of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board, and with other steps in the scheme. 

##### Mr ARCHIE CAMERON:<br><small class="text-muted">Barker &middot; ALP</small>

.- What will be the position of the Government after a grower of wheat has appealed to and obtained a decision from the High Court? I am confident that an appeal will be made to the High Court in New South Wales. I am equal  y  confident that the High Court will declare that the Commonwealth Government cannot deduct any amount from the receipt? from the 1945-46 crop, and that it must, pay to the growers the full realization... . Would it not be better to provide now for a contingency which must arise, instead pf waiting until the Hgh Court has given its decision, when, if the statement of the Minister be correct, the bill will have to be recast and returned to this Parliament for reconsideration? I cannot understand the attitude of the Ministry on this matter. To my mind, it has neither a legal nor a moral right to take this wheat under the proposed conditions, and place it in the stabilization scheme. This is retrospective legislation of the worst character. If the Government refuses to recognize what is a fair thing, the legislation will be upset in the courts. The Government- has been warned. Should the present Ministry be in office when the legislation is returned to this Parliament for reconsideration, we shall have much to say to it. 

##### Mr McEWEN:<br><small class="text-muted">Indi</small>

--  I recognize that the Minister stated a fact when he said that if the proclamation of the act were deferred until October, 1946, the election of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board, and all associated matters, would be delayed. Ordinarily, that would be a very powerful argument in rebuttal. However, I support the honorable mem-ber for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron),,**  because his amendment is designed to. take whatever action is open to him to block what' he, I, and all other honorable members on this side of the chamber regard as an obnoxious legislative proposal. I would support any amendment calculated to prevent or delay the operation of this retrospective legislation. At the most, the acceptance of the amendment would merely have the effect of preventing any action taken under the legislation from becoming operative until there had been an appeal to the people in a few months hence. That, in itself, is sufficient reason for my strong support of the amendment. 

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- I welcome the opportunity to support the amendment. I would do anything to hamper the intention of the Govern.ment to bring into this scheme the wheat produced in the 1945-46 crop. That wheat having been acquired under wartime regulations, it cannot justly be included in the scheme. The wheatgrowers were led to believe that they would receive cash for the wheat that . they grew in that year. Many of them entered into financial commitments which must be taken into account, because they have to be met. Believing that the receipts from the 1945-46 crop would become available to them, they purchased different articles which they considered would assist them to continue production. If this legislation be carried, they will be left high and dry. 

##### Mr FADDEN:<br><small class="text-muted">Darling Downs Leader of the Australian Country party</small>

--  I feel it incumbent on me to protest against the inclusion of the 1945-46 wheat crop in the stabilization scheme. I am sure that honorable members must have been impressed by the logical advocacy of the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  during his most eloquent second-reading speech last night. The honorable gentleman is well qualified to give an opinion on the constitutionality of the Government's action. He pointed out that the Government must give consideration to the claims of the growers, and also stated that equity must be observed in the conditions under which the crop wag acquired, the price received for it, and the general circumstances of the transaction. It is difficult to follow the reasoning of the Government. For the reasons which have been advanced. 1 oppose its action and support the amendment of the honorable member for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron).** 

##### Mr TURNBULL:<br><small class="text-muted">WIMMERA, VICTORIA &middot; CP</small>

-- It appears to me that the Government has not a furl knowledge of what has happened during the last few years in certain wheat areas. Since I have been a member of this Parliament, I have heard the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  **(Mr. Scully)**  sympathize with the wheat-growers in the northern and southern parts of the Wimmera electorate in their sorry plight. I believe that he would co-operate in giving them a chance to rehabilitate themselves, more particularly at the present time, when it is necessary to increase production in order to help feed the starving millions in Europe. When I passed through the Wimmera electorate after an absence of five years overseas,  J.  was amazed at the deterioration of houses, fencing and machinery. The wheat-grower has now an opportunity to obtain a reasonable return from the good prices that are prevailing overseas; but this legislation will debar him from- taking advantage of it and thus rehabilitating himself. During the drought, severe dust storms swept through the country. I heard' recently of men who had had to cease fencing work on which they were engaged, because of a dust storm. When they returned to the scene of their labours, they could not find the wire they had intended to use because it was covered with dust. In some of the country which has produced wheat in the past, the houses are in a deplorable state because of the dust that has banked up against them. The costs of everything which the wheatgrowers require have risen so - greatly that this extra money is urgently needed by them. Perhaps never before in the history of the wheat industry would so little money have been so useful, because it would provide these producers with a slight breathing space, although not nearly adequate, and help to place them on a sound basis. Half a loaf is- better than no bread. Depriving them of the money will not be in the best interests of - the growers individually or of the industry as a whole. I support the amendment. 

##### Mr ABBOTT:<br><small class="text-muted">New England</small>

-- I support the amendment, particularly for the reason that large areas of wheat lands in Australia are suffering severely from the effects of drought. This applies particularly in the mixed farming areas. It has been calculated by  **Mr. Bartlett.**  the agricultural expert, that throughout an area of 4,500,000 acres the wheat crops are in the balance. This applies to some of the areas in the south, whilst in the north-west of New South Wales it is almost certain that the crops will be a complete failure. Therefore, the farmers will need all the money that might be coming to them for their 1945-46 crop in order to recoup their present losses. 

##### Mr LEMMON:<br><small class="text-muted">Forrest</small>

.- A lot of humbug has been talked about the 1945-46 crop. The honorable member for Wimmera  **(Mr. Turnbull)**  said that the farmers had entered into certain commitments, and if they were to honour those commitments it was necessary that they should receive the full market price for the 1945-46 crop. The general principles of the proposed stabilization plan were known to the farmers before the last harvest. Therefore, before the harvest . was reaped, the farmers would know that they should not enter into commitments that would leave them in financial difficulties. Moreover, very few farmers were likely to enter into commitments before September last on the basis that they would receive for their wheat 6s. 7d. a bushel f.o.b., or 5s. lOd. at sidings - prices higher than any received during the last twenty years. The honorable member for New England  **(Mr. Abbott)**  mentioned drought. The farmers who suffered from the effects of drought last vear should be supporting the Government's stabilization proposal, because those who had a good crop in that season are the very  one3  who will be contributing most to the stabilization pool. The honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr.-** 

Spender), with all his legal humbug, tried to prove that the Government's proposals were invalid.. As a lawyer, he should support the sanctity of contracts, and the Government's stabilization proposals are the outcome of a contract entered into between it and the Australian. Wheat Growers Federation. The agreement of the representatives of the federation is recorded in the minutes of that body. The 1945-46 harvest was included in the scheme because it was agreed to by the representatives of the wheat-growers themselves. 

##### Mr ADERMANN:<br><small class="text-muted">Maranoa</small>

-- I am sure that the representatives of the wheat-growers in Queensland did not agree to .the proposal to include the 1945-46 crop in the stabilization scheme.. The Queensland Wheat Board, which was elected by the growers, is against tho inclusion of the crop, but the Minister is silent on that point. 

##### Mr Scully:

--  That statement is incorrect. The  chairman  of the Queensland Wheat Board accepted that arrangement at a conference held in this very chamber. It was also accepted by the Minister for Agriculture in Queensland. 

##### Mr ADERMANN:

-- A member of th« Queensland Wheat Board told me over the telephone only yesterday that they wanted the 1945-46 crop to be excluded. Not one grower knew, when .he sowed hia wheat that season, that a part of the proceeds of the crop would be diverted as is now proposed. As the honorable member for Warringah  **(Mr. Spender)**  pointed out, the High Court has ruled that any commodity acquired under the National Security Regulations should bc acquired on reasonable terms. There will certainly be a lot of humbugging if, after the scheme has been put into operation, it is found that the act is invalid. The Queensland wheat-growers need the full return from last year's crop, because there will be no crop this year owing to the drought. 

##### Mr ANTHONY:<br><small class="text-muted">Richmond</small>

-- I support the amendment of the honorable member" for Barker  **(Mr. Archie Cameron)**  that the commencement date for the operation of the scheme should he advanced. In replying to the secondreading debate, the Minister sounded very convincing, and I have no doubt that he spoke in all sincerity when he recounted  the circumstances in which it was decided to include the 1945-46 harvest in the scheme. However, I believe that in a matter of such importance Parliament and the representatives of the industries are entitled to have a second look at the matter. It is well known that at the original conference many of the representatives of the wheat-growers agreed to the present proposal, which then looked very attractive, but they had little time to analyse the situation. Since the conference referred to by the Minister, there has been a strong swing of opinion among representatives of wheat-growers' organizations. The Minister told us about the conference at Perth in December last, but lie did not tell us about a conference which was held in April, and which reversed the decision reached at the Deceml.*r conference. 

##### Mr Scully:

-- Was there not a conference in June which reversed the decision of the conference in .April? 

##### Mr ANTHONY:

-- Now we are extracting some real information from the Minister, because from the statement he made earlier one would suppose that one conference made this decision and has stood adamantly by it. The Minister now admits that there has been more than one conference. In view of the injustice likely to be done to a very large section of primary producers we should take a little time at least to examine, not only the justice of this proposal, but also its . constitutional aspect. The Government has been fully warned that those engaged in the industry will not take this proposal lightly,' but will challenge it on constitutional grounds. Money does not seem to matter much to honorable members opposite. The balancing of the budget is a thing of the past so far as this Government is concerned. Reduction of taxes implies economy of administration; but it is not administrative economy to spend thousands of pounds of the taxpayers' money in fighting a legal battle which we can avert by taking a little more time to consider the implications of this proposal. A most flagrant injustice is being done to the wheat-growers who are to bc deprived of the benefit they expected to derive from the 1945-46 harvest. If the principle* of retrospective taxation were applied to the war-time earnings of the man on the basic wage he would rend the heavens with his protests. The wheat-grower is in a similar position. Under this proposal he is to be taxed retrospectively. Members of the Opposition, particularly members of the Australian Country party, who. if they are not wheat-growers are primary producers, would be failing in their duty if they did not take strong exception tothis proposal. It is strange that in respect of this vital matter the honorable member for Forrest  **(Mr. Lemmon)**  is the only  honorable member opposite who has spoken on this clause. He is the apologist for the Government. He makes the excuses for the Government. He partnered the Minister in the formulation ofthese proposals. The honorable member for Hume  **(Mr. Fuller),**  the honorable member for Wakefield  **(Mr. Smith),**  and other honorable members opposite who sit in this chamber as representatives, of wheat-growing constituencies, are prepared to allow this proposal to go through because they, are not game to say one word either against it or in support of it. 

Progress reported. 

House adjourned at 11 p.m.
