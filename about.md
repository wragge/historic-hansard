# About

This site was built using [Hansard XML files](https://github.com/wragge/hansard-xml) made available by the Parliament of Australia under a [CC-BY-NC-ND licence](http://www.aph.gov.au/Help/Disclaimer_Privacy_Copyright#c).

The XML files were harvested in April 2016 from the [ParlInfo database](http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/search.w3p;orderBy=_fragment_number,doc_date-rev;query=Dataset%3Ahansardr,hansardr80;resCount=Default). It's possible I missed some files -- please let me know if you notice any gaps. As you browse the site you'll find many examples where the XML mark-up isn't quite right. You can help improve this by forking and fixing files from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wragge/hansard-xml).

The first version of this site was built in a weekend using Python to process the XML and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to render the results as a static site. The [site's code](https://github.com/wragge/historic-hansard) is also available on GitHub.

The functionality is intentionally limited. This is a demonstration project. Nonetheless, I think it offers a useful alternative to ParlInfo. There you can search Hansard for relevant fragments. Here you can read, and explore in context.
