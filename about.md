# About

This site was built using [Hansard XML files](https://github.com/wragge/hansard-xml) made available by the Parliament of Australia website under a [CC-BY-NC-ND licence](http://www.aph.gov.au/Help/Disclaimer_Privacy_Copyright#c).

The XML files were harvested in April 2016 -- please let me know if you notice any gaps. As you browse the site you'll find many examples where the XML mark-up isn't quite right. You can help improve this by forking and fixing files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wragge/hansard-xml).

The first version of this site was built in a weekend using Python and Jekyll.
